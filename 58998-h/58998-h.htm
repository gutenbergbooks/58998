<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>An effort is made in the following pages to set forth
what the New Testament church was when it came into the
world through the preaching of inspired men; how it was
led into apostasy; and an account of some of the many
attempts to restore it to its original purity and simplicity.</p>
<p>In proportion as any religious work becomes a potent
force in affecting the welfare of mankind, its early history
becomes interesting and important. This is especially true
of the very beginning of its history where those influences
which have molded its character are most clearly seen. It is
due to the world no less than to the heroic men who were
chief actors in such a movement, that the motives which
inspired them, the principles which guided them, and the
forces which opposed them, together with the results of this
conflict, should be set down accurately for the information
and for the benefit of those who are seeking the truth.</p>
<p>If the writer did not most profoundly believe that this
effort to restore the New Testament church was one of those
providential movements designed by Jehovah to correct
existing evils, and to purify religion from its corruptions
that the gospel may run and be glorified in the earth, then
he would feel but little interest in its history and achievements.
But recognizing, as I do, the hand of God in this
remarkable movement of the nineteenth century, it is believed
that an important service is being rendered by putting on
record the causes which gave birth to it, and the influences
which by action and reaction have made it what it is. If
God overrules in human affairs, and teaches men by means
of history, then he who faithfully records historic facts fulfills
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
an important service in the education of men. This is
pre-eminently true of that kind of history which deals with
the struggles of the human mind and heart to know God, and
to understand his will concerning human redemption.</p>
<p>It is of the very greatest importance to the successful
carrying forward of the Lord&rsquo;s work that the younger generation
should become thoroughly acquainted with the spirit
which animated, and the principles which controlled the men
who, under God, gave the primary impulse to this great work.
They should become familiar with the conflicts of those
early days and with the tremendous sacrifices made by those
valiant men and women who loved the truth more than popularity,
more than ease, more than wealth, friends, and family
ties. It is only as we shall be able to perpetuate this love
of truth, this freedom from the bondage of tradition and
inherited opinions, that we shall be able to carry forward,
successfully the work they inaugurated.</p>
<p>We need the same dauntless heroism, the same faith
in God, the same zeal for truth and the same underlying
principles which characterized them and who have transmitted
to us the responsibility of carrying forward the work
which they began. If this volume which is now sent forth
shall serve to inspire the workers who are to succeed us with
the same passion for pure apostolic Christianity, with the
same spirit of loyalty to Christ, which marked the beginning
of their work, the purpose of the writer shall have been fulfilled.</p>

<h2>PART I.
<br />The Church.</h2>
<h3 id="c2">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="h3line2">WHAT SHOULD THE CHURCH OF THE PRESENT BE?</span></h3>
<p>That the church is the bride of Christ is clearly expressed
in the following: &ldquo;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were
made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye
should be joined to another, even to him who was raised
from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God&rdquo;
(Rom. 7:4). &ldquo;For I am jealous over you with a godly
jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might
present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (II Cor. 11:2).
In these passages the bride evidently means the church.
That the bride will remain till the Bridegroom comes there
can be no reasonable doubt; that she has ever waited his
coming is equally certain. She has been in great distress,
being driven into the wilderness and deprived of much of
her glory, but she has ever looked for the coming of her
espoused. In what condition the Bridegroom will find her
is a question about which there has been much speculation.
Unless we believe that the Bridegroom, when he comes, will
find his bride in dishonor&mdash;living in fornication with the
world&mdash;we may not measure the church by human standards.
That the bride will be found wearing the name of the
Bridegroom and living in chastity when he comes to claim
her, there is no room for reasonable doubt. The world may
be deeply defiled by crime, but the church will be arrayed
in her robes of righteousness. Hence, while the church
may have its impurities, as everything composed of humanity
has, it must at least be uncontaminated to the extent of
fidelity to Christ. This may cut off much of what the world
calls the church, but not what God regards as the church.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
This has ever been the case since the apostasy, and will
doubtless so continue to the end.</p>
<p>In the days of the apostles, God had a people in Babylon,
but while they were in Babylon they were not of Babylon.
Hence the Lord says: &ldquo;Come forth, my people, out of her,
that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive
not her plagues&rdquo; (Rev. 18:4). God doubtless has a people
in Babylon now; but they and Babylon are two distinct
things. God&rsquo;s church is not composed of the Babel of
sectarianism. Just who God&rsquo;s people are who may now be
in Babylon it is not my purpose to determine. God has
revealed to us the things that pertain to his church&mdash;the
faith, the practice, and the promises&mdash;and with these it is
my purpose to deal. Here, all is faith and assurance; beyond
this, all is opinion and fruitless speculation. Concerning
those in Babylon we have but one living direction. &ldquo;Come
forth, my people, out of her.&rdquo; To this we should give
faithful heed. For to console people in the Babylon of
sectarianism, and to reconcile them to their bondage, we
have no divine right; but to deliver them from it is a divine
obligation. Therefore God&rsquo;s church is an institution separate
and distinct from the Babel of denominationalism.</p>
<p>In determining, then, what the church should be, it will
be necessary to ascertain the characteristics of the apostolic
church. If the church of the present day be essentially different
from the apostolic as a matter of preference, it can
not be the church of which God is the author. Hence it can
not be a divine institution, neither can it be the virgin
bride of Christ. It follows, therefore, that the church must
possess the following characteristics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <span class="sc">It Must Be a Divine Institution</span></p>
<p>At the beginning the church was a divine institution,
and it can not cease to be divine and still be the
church of God, for God does not begin with the
divine and end with the human. Beginning in the
spirit the things of God are not made perfect in the
flesh. A divine institution must have for its organization
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and essential features divine authority, for
the world can not make an ordinance or an institution
divine. It must be specially appointed of God.
No human institution, therefore, nor combination of
institutions for which there is no special divine appointment,
can ever constitute the church of God, for
it is of God and not of men. Hence the church must
be in all its essential features of specific divine appointment.
These appointments are all found in the
New Testament; therefore, the church to be a divine
institution must be fashioned after that model.</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">It Must Be Governed Wholly by Divine Authority.</span></p>
<p>The church was governed wholly by divine authority
at the beginning. Should it substitute human
for divine authority it would cease to be the church
of God. A substitute for a divine thing can never
itself be divine; therefore, anything substituted for
the church as it was in the beginning is not that
church. Just as certainly therefore, as Christ will
own and accept his church when he comes again, so
certainly will it be governed by his authority. Christ
will accept only the church which he established.
That which he established was governed wholly by
divine authority: therefore the church of today must
be so governed.</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">It Should Have Only the Names It Had at
the Beginning.</span></p>
<p>In the New Testament there are various names
applied to the church and to its members. All these
names have their significance, for the Holy Spirit
never used them by accident, and for these names,
and for these only, is there divine authority. The
true church of to-day will be governed by divine authority;
therefore, only these will the church accept.
This with it is not simply a matter of taste, but of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
loyalty to Christ. Names unknown to the New
Testament have come of the apostasy.</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">It Must Have the Form of Government Given
to the Church in the Beginning.</span></p>
<p>It must necessarily be true, since it recognizes
only the same authority. The church of to-day could
not disregard the government of the New Testament
church and still be the same church. Its congregations
are not bound in the coils of an ecclesiasticism
as merciless as it is unscriptural. Its bishops are not
diocesan, but congregational. There are not a plurality
of churches, under one bishop, but a plurality of
bishops in one church. Its government is not in the
hands of a legislative body, but it is under the legislation
of Christ, executed by the several congregations.</p>
<p>5. <span class="sc">It Has the Unity of the Church of the New
Testament.</span></p>
<p>This conclusion is reached from several considerations.
(1) Since the church is governed only by
divine authority, has the same form of government
that it had in the beginning, and wears only the names
found in the New Testament, the unity that characterized
the first church follows as a consequence.
(2) The destruction of the unity of the church was
the work of the apostasy; hence when the church is
reclaimed from the apostasy it will be freed from
this disunion. (3) There can be no doubt that
Christ&rsquo;s prayer for the unity of his people can now
be fulfilled as it was at the beginning. This unity
can never exist through denominational walls. There
were no denominational walls between the Father and
the Son, neither was there any between the first disciples.
Hence, if that prayer is answered in the
restoration of the church, and it must be, there must
be the same unity that characterized the church in
the beginning.</p>

<h3 id="c3">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE CHURCH AND THE TEMPLE</span></h3>
<p>Under the Patriarchal and Jewish dispensation there
were numerous animal sacrifices by divine appointment. Not
only so, but the people generally, who knew not the true
God, have, all down the ages, poured sacrificial blood upon
altars innumerable. This must have come about by the perversion
of divinely-appointed sacrificial institutions, or from
the felt need of fallen man for some way of mediation and
of approach to God. That the need was felt by true worshipers
is not open to doubt, for if sacrifice were devised
by man, it would only have arisen from a sense of that need;
and, on the other hand, if ordained of God, it could only have
been acceptably offered under a consciousness thereof.</p>
<p>Sacrifices, altars and priests have generally stood together;
and so long as they have been upon divine lines have
been highly beneficial. But it has been alleged that priests
have been a curse rather than a blessing to the nations, and
I am not prepared to dispute the allegation. But neither
God nor the Bible is responsible, because the priesthood as
instituted by the Jews was a good and not an evil to that
people; while, on the other hand, the priestly system has no
place in Christianity. The priests of heathendom and of
Christendom are not of God. Then how widely different,
how completely opposite, is the unpriestly worship of the
Church of Christ from the sacerdotal ceremonies of the
Jewish economy. There we find the costly temple, in the
construction of which were gold, silver, precious stones and
costly fabrics in unrestricted abundance; sacred places over
which the people may not pass, and which the feet of priests
and Levites only may tread; ceremonials which bring death
to those who touch them with other than priestly hands;
altars and fires, blood and incense, and priests, all of divine
ordering, so that we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before
Jehovah. And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.
So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites
also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the
King had made to give thanks unto Jehovah (for his loving
kindness endureth forever), when David raised by their ministry;
and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all
Israel stood. Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the
court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered
and burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because
the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
the burnt offering, and the meat offering, and the fat.</p>
<p>So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of
Hamath unto the brook of Egypt. And on the eighth day they
held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the
altar seven days, and the feast seven days. And on the three
and twentieth day of the seventh month, he sent the people
away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness
that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and
to Israel his people. (II Chron. 7:4-10.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significance, and richness, and glory of that economy
surpassed anything that the world had ever seen; but in the
fullness of time it was superseded by a higher and more glorious
dispensation, concerning which the Apostle Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:
not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as
from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; who also made
us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter,
but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life. But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven
on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could
not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of
his face which glory was passing away: how shall not rather
the ministration of the spirit be with glory? For if the ministration
of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the
ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For verily that
which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious
in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth. For
if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that
which remains is in glory. (II Cor. 3:4-11.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shall we, then, look for still greater material splendor
and wealth in temples, vestments, altars and instruments of
music? If not, why not? And still, if not, why did the
like exist under the former and inferior economy? We
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
should look for nothing of the sort, nor suffer its intrusion
upon the Church of Christ, and that for one reason, sufficient
without others equally good&mdash;the former economy, in
all its ceremonials, was typical of spiritual blessings then to
come. There was a perfect typical system most expressive
and opposite, but rendered useless when its antitypes appeared.
The cross took the place of the altar; the High
Priest of our confession came in the room of the Aaronic
priesthood, &ldquo;the sacrifice of praise,&rdquo; &ldquo;that is the fruit of our
lips,&rdquo; set aside the praise by trumpets, psaltery and cymbal.
These were good and expressive in their day and place. &ldquo;A
shadow of things to come; but the body is Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:17).
&ldquo;For the law having a shadow of good things to
come, not the very image of the things, can never with the
same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually,
make perfect them that draw nigh. Else would they not
have ceased to be offered?&rdquo; (Heb. 10:1). So we see that
the Holy Spirit very aptly informs us that &ldquo;the body&rdquo; or
substance, is Christ&rsquo;s, and when he came and filled to the
full the types and shadows of the law, they passed away in
their entirety, giving place to higher institutions, by means of
which the worshipers could be made perfect. &ldquo;And not
only so,&rdquo; as a ripe Bible student very forcefully says, &ldquo;but
just in proportion as these abandoned shadows are intruded
into the church and worship of God they become injurious
and more or less substitutes for the realities of which, in
their day and place, they were the proper types and symbols.
Consequently, in setting in order, by the apostles, of the
Church of Christ, the temple and its worship were in no
degree taken as models, and this is highly reasonable, inasmuch
as the existence together of the type and the antitype
would be completely inadmissible. Nothing could have been
easier than for the apostles to have adopted priestly, or
modified priestly vestments. There could have been no
manner of difficulty in burning incense as an act of praise
of worship. It can not be supposed but that, long before
the close of the apostolic ministry, they could have used
and enjoined the use of instrumental music. But no! Nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the kind; no trace even of a leaning, or of a desire,
in that direction. The things of the shadows were done
with, and those of the substance took their place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the church is not modeled after the temple, but
after the synagogue, is established beyond doubt by the testimony
of the learned men in the denominational world. If
objection be made to the inconsistency of denominational
scholars putting forth such views, I answer that it is a well-known
fact that men do confess truths that they fail to carry
into effect; but the truth is not weakened thereby, but rather
derives additional weight from the fact that it forces confession,
even against the interests and associations of those
who utter it. But however that may be, they write the truth
abundantly clear.</p>
<p>The first witness I introduce is &ldquo;Richard Watson,&rdquo; who
the McClintock and Strong Cyclopedia says &ldquo;gave the first
systematic treatment of Wesleyan theology. His Institutes,
though not the legal, have been the moral and scientific
standard of Methodist doctrine.&rdquo; All aspirants to the
Methodist pulpit are required to study &ldquo;Watson&rsquo;s Theological
Institutes.&rdquo; He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The course of the synagogue worship became indeed the
model of that of the Christian Church. It consisted in prayer,
reading and explaining the Scriptures, and singing psalms;
and thus one of the most important means of instructing nations,
and of spreading and maintaining the influence of morals
and religion among people, passed from the Jews into all Christian
countries.... The mode of public worship in the
primitive church was taken from the synagogue service; and so,
also, was its arrangements of offices.... Such was the
model which the apostles followed in providing for the future
regulation of the churches they had raised up. They took it,
not from the temple and its priesthood, for that was typical,
and was then passing away. But they found in the institution
of the synagogues a plan admirably adapted to the simplicity
and purity of Christianity, ... and which was
capable of being applied to the new dispensation without danger
of Judaizing. (Theological Institutes, pages 640, 683, 684.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyman Coleman, Presbyterian, who was &ldquo;eminent in
solid abilities, in accurate scholarship, in stores of accumulated
learning, and in extended usefulness,&rdquo; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>He (Jesus) was a constant attendant upon the religious
worship of the synagogue, and, after his ascension, his disciples
conformed their acts of worship to those of the synagogue.
They consisted in prayer, in singing and in the reading
and exposition of the Scriptures, as appears from the
writers of the New Testament, from the earliest Christian
fathers, and from profane writers of the first two centuries.
(Ancient Christianity Exemplified, page 94.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eminent scholar of the Church of England, G. A.
Jacob, in his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical Polity of the New Testament,&rdquo;
which is used as a text-book in some of the Episcopal theological
seminaries in this country, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the temple was the priest consecrated according to a
precise regulation, and a sarcedotal succession laid down by
God himself, with the altar and its sacrifices at which he officiated,
the incense which he burned, the holy places into which
none might enter but those to whom it was especially assigned.
In the synagogue was the reader of the Scriptures, the preacher
or expounder of religious and moral truth, the leader of the
common devotions of the people, unconsecrated by any special
rites, and unrestricted by any rule of succession; with a reading
desk or pulpit at which he stood, but with no altar, sacrifice
or incense, and no part of the building more holy than
the rest. And without attempting now to dwell upon all the
remarkable contrasts thus displayed, it may suffice to say that
the temple exhibited in a grand combination of typical places,
persons and actions. God dwelling with man, reconciling the
world unto himself in the person and work of Christ; and pardoning,
justifying and graciously receiving those who come to
him through the appointed Saviour; while the synagogue exhibited
a congregation of men, already reconciled to God, assembled
as devout worshipers for prayer and praise, for instruction
in divine knowledge, and edification in righteous
living. And the two systems&mdash;the one gorgeous and typical,
the other simple and real; in one, God drawing near to man,
in the other, man drawing near to God&mdash;never clashed or interfered
with each other; were never intermingled or confounded
together. In the temple there was no pulpit, in the synagogue
there was no altar.... They (apostles) retained and
adapted to Christian use some Jewish forms and regulations;
but they were taken altogether not from the temple, but from
the synagogue. The offices which they appointed in the church,
and the duties and authority which they attached to them, together
with the regulations which they made for Christian
worship, bore no resemblance in name or in nature to the
services of the priesthood in the temple. The apostles had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
divinely taught that those priests and services were typical
forms and shadows, which were centered, and fulfilled, and
done away in Christ; and to reinstate them in the Church would
have been in their judgment to go back to the bondage of
&ldquo;weak and beggarly elements&rdquo; from the liberty, strength and
rich completeness of the Gospel dispensation. They saw that
as the ordinances of the temple represented the work of God
wrought out for man, not man&rsquo;s work for God, to continue them
after that work was finished in the life and death of Jesus,
would be in effect so far to deny the efficacy of the Saviour&rsquo;s
mission, and to thrust in the miserable performances of men to
fill up an imagined imperfection in the Son  of God. (Ecclesiastical
Polity, pages 96-98.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The apostles, therefore, by the directions of the Holy
Spirit adopted official arrangements similar to those of the
synagogue, and discarded those of the temple, in the institution
of church offices, and plainly showed by this circumstance
that no priestly powers or duties were attached
to their ministrations. Another argument which leads to
the same conclusion is deduced from the condition of the
members of the Church as it appears in the New Testament,
and the equality of standing in Christ, which Christians
possessed. The way of access to God being open to all
without distinction through the priesthood of Christ, there
was nothing for a priest to do&mdash;no sacerdotal work or office
for him to undertake.</p>
<p>On this phase of the subject, Mr. Jacob has said some
very pointed things, and I will call on him to give testimony.
He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A distinct proof that the office bearers in the Church of the
Apostles were not, and could not be priests, or perform any
sacerdotal duties, is seen in a condensed form in the epistle
to the Hebrews, and is found at large in the whole of the Old
and the New Testaments, of which that epistle, as far as the
subject reaches, is so valuable an epitome. We there learn
that from the very nature of the priestly office, it is necessary
for those who hold it to be specially called and appointed by
God, either personally by name, or according to a divinely instituted
order of succession; and that, since the patriarchal
dispensation, only two orders of priesthood have ever had this
necessary divine sanction granted to them. The two orders
are the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedek. The
priests of the former order belonged to the Jewish dispensation
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
only, and have indisputably passed away. The only priest
after the order of Melchisedek, even mentioned in the Bible, is
our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;the &ldquo;priest upon his throne,&rdquo; without
a successor, as he had none before him, in the everlasting priesthood
of his mediatorial reign. This argument appears to me
to be conclusive. It appears to me that the epistle to the
Hebrews shuts out the possibility of there being any other
priest in the Church besides Christ himself. But this does not
so appear to a large number of our clergy. Bishops as far
back as the third century claimed to be successors or vicegerents
of Christ on earth; and our presbyters do not hesitate
to declare that they are priests after the order of Melchisedek.
To my mind and feeling this is an impious claim; but countenanced
as they are by numberless past and present examples,
good men are not conscious of impiety in making it. But, then
it is necessary to ask the &ldquo;priests&rdquo; for their credentials. Where
is the record of their divine appointment to the sacerdotal
office? In what part of the New Testament, and in what form
of words, is the institution of such priests, and the manner of
their succession, to be found? And to such inquiries no satisfactory
answer has been or can be given. (Ibid, pages 102-104.)</p>

<h3 id="c4">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="h3line2">INFANT BAPTISM</span></h3>
<p>Another point in which the Church of Christ and the
Jewish Covenant are at exact opposites is that of infant
membership. In the Apostolic Church baptism preceded
membership, and faith was prerequisite to baptism, consequently
there was not, neither could be any place for
infant membership. On this account we have in the New
Testament neither precept for, nor example of, infant baptism,
but on the contrary, much that renders it totally incompatible
with apostolic teaching.</p>
<p>But we are reminded by the advocates of infant baptism
that in some sense baptism stands to its subject and the
Church as circumcision did under the Abrahamic covenant.
They emphasize that as an unquestioned fact, and seem to
think there ought to be something in it, somewhere or somehow,
in favor of infant baptism. Some claim that circumcision
initiated into the Church under the former dispensation,
and that baptism is initiative now; and that infants
were formerly initiated by circumcision, and should now be
initiated by baptism. Others hold that circumcision was a
declaration of church membership under the Jewish dispensation;
and that baptism is a declaration of membership
now: and that as circumcision was extended to infants, so
baptism should be extended. They further claim that
infants were put in the Church which was established in
the family of Abraham; that the Church of the old dispensation
is identical with that of the new; that no law
has since been enacted to put them out; and that they
were then initiated by circumcision and that, as baptism
has superseded circumcision, infants should now be initiated
by baptism.</p>
<p>To some this is a strong and satisfactory argument, but
a few plain, simple facts should decide the question whether
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the Church of the new covenant is identical with that of
the old and that baptism takes the place of circumcision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) &ldquo;The covenant of circumcision&rdquo; (Acts 7:8)
was a covenant with Abraham and to him &ldquo;that is
born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
money&rdquo; (Gen. 17:12, 13); while the new covenant
embraces believers in Jesus Christ, without respect to
Abraham&rsquo;s flesh or money. (See II Cor. 5:16, 17;
Gal. 3:26-29; Heb. 8:8-12.)</p>
<p>(2) Male children alone were subjects of circumcision.
If baptism took the place of circumcision,
none but the males should be baptized; but the advocates
of infant baptism contend that infants should
be baptized regardless of sex, flesh or money.</p>
<p>(3) If baptism came in the place of circumcision,
persons already circumcised could not be baptized.
If the one came in the place of the other,
the two could not exist at the same time in the same
person. But all the Jews that had been circumcised
on believing in Christ were baptized. The children
of Jewish Christians were still circumcised. Is it
possible that pedobaptists are so blinded in their contention
for infant baptism that they can not see this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there is a point of similarity between circumcision
and baptism there is no doubt, for Paul says: &ldquo;In whom
ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with
hands, in the putting off the body of the flesh, in the circumcision
of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism,
wherein ye were also raised with him through the faith in
the working of God, who raised him from the dead&rdquo; (Col.
2:11, 12). In circumcision the foreskin of the flesh was
cut off by the hands; so in baptism the sins were put off,
and this putting off the sins was called &ldquo;a circumcision not
made with hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mosaic law given to the fleshly family of Abraham
typified to some extent the spiritual family of God. Circumcision
marked those born of the flesh as members of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
kingdom of Israel; baptism marks those begotten of the
Spirit as members of God&rsquo;s spiritual kingdom. To affix the
spiritual mark to the fleshly birth is to do violence to the
figure and to introduce those born of the flesh into the spiritual
kingdom. Now faith is the first manifestation of the
spiritual begetting, and only those begotten of the Spirit and
manifesting it in faith can be introduced into the spiritual
kingdom, or should have the mark of God&rsquo;s spiritual child.
To place the mark of the birth of the Spirit upon one born of
the flesh is to mislead and deceive that child and make the impression
that it is one of God&rsquo;s spiritual children when it is
not. The Spirit of God always connects the fleshly mark with
the fleshly birth into the fleshly kingdom, and the spiritual
mark (baptism) with the spiritual birth into the spiritual
kingdom. Hence the Holy Spirit says: &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and
teach all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19).
&ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to the
whole creation. He that believeth and is baptized shall
be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned&rdquo;
(Mark 16:15, 16). &ldquo;Repent ye, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission
of your sins&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). &ldquo;And now why tarriest thou,
arise, and be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on
the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). Only those capable
of believing, repenting and of thus showing that they are
begotten of the Spirit, are fit subjects for baptism. To
bestow the mark of the spiritual birth on those born of the
flesh is to break down and carnalize the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The prophet says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the
land of Egypt: which my covenant they brake, although I was
a husband unto them, saith Jehovah. But this is the covenant
that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and
in their hearts will I write it; and I will be their God, and they
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man
his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know
Jehovah: for they shall all know me from the least of them
unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive
their iniquity, and their sins will I remember no more. (Jer. 31:31-34.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that a new covenant different from that he
made at Sinai would be made. That was a fleshly covenant
with the house of Israel, into which they were born
by a fleshly birth; but in the new covenant the law was to
be written on their hearts, and all were to know him, from
the least to the greatest. That is, all must know the law
of God, accept it in their hearts before they could become
members of the Church of God. So Paul asks: &ldquo;What
then is the law? It was added because of transgressions,
till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been
made&rdquo; (Gal. 3:19). The seed that was to come was Christ,
and this plainly shows that because of the transgression this
law was to continue only until Christ should come. Then
the new spiritual covenant was to go into force, and the
members of it were all to believe in Christ.</p>
<p>The following significant contrast is drawn by the
Apostle Paul: &ldquo;Ye are our epistle written in our hearts,
known and read of all men; being made manifest that ye
are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with
ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of
stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh. And such confidence
have we through Christ to Godward: not that we
are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves;
but our sufficiency is from God, who also made us
sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter,
but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life. But if the ministration of death, written and engraven
on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel
could not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses for the
glory of his face; which glory was passing away: how shall
not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? For
if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather
doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
verily that which hath been made glorious hath not
been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the
glory that surpasseth. For if that which passeth away
was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in
glory&rdquo; (II Cor. 3:2-11). In this the Ten Commandments,
written upon the tables of stone, is contrasted with the
law of Christ, written in the hearts of God&rsquo;s children.
The law written on stones is called &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; that &ldquo;killeth.&rdquo;
It convicted of sin, but had no power to deliver from it. The
sins were rolled and rolled year by year until Jesus came
and shed blood, not only for our sins but for &ldquo;the redemption
of the transgressions that were under the first covenant
that they that have been called may receive the promise of
the eternal inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter to the Hebrews was written to show the change
from the old covenant to the new, and to show the immense
superiority of the new to the old. To turn back from the
spiritual law and the Church of Christ to the fleshly law and
institution of Judaism is called falling &ldquo;away from grace.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by
the law; ye are fallen away from grace&rdquo; (Gal. 5:4).</p>
<p>Since it is so very evident that there is no ground whatever
for infant baptism based on the arguments on the analogy
of circumcision and the identity of the covenants it is quite
appropriate to close this article with quotations from two
great pedobaptist scholars. Dr. Jacob Ditzler, claimed to be
the best debater the Methodist Church has produced, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I here express my conviction that the covenants of the
Old Testament have nothing to do with infant baptism.
(Graves-Ditzler Debate, page 694).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moses Stuart, Congregationalist, Professor of Sacred
Literature in Andover Theological Seminary, called &ldquo;The
Father of Biblical Literature in America,&rdquo; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How unwary, too, are many excellent men, in contending
for infant baptism on the ground of the Jewish analogy of
circumcision! Are females not proper subjects of baptism?
And again, are a man&rsquo;s slaves to be all baptized because he is?
Are they church members of course when they are so baptized?
Is there no difference between ingrafting into a politico-ecclesiastical
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
community, and into one of which it is said that
&ldquo;it is not of this world?&rdquo; In short, numberless difficulties present
themselves in our way, as soon as we begin to argue in
such a manner as this. (Old Testament Canon, &sect; 22, page 369.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the investigation thus far we have learned that under
the old covenant infants were included, so were slaves, taken
in war or bought with money. The covenant was with a
nation, involving national laws and customs, and promising
national and temporal blessings. The duly recognized, as
embraced under that covenant, were not thereby entitled to
eternal life. As the entire flesh of the nation, for national
purposes, was included, the infants of that nation, from the
moment of birth, stood in covenant relation with God and
the covenant people. There was no ceremonial by which they
entered into that relationship&mdash;they were born into it. They
came not in by circumcision, for the male infant, continuing
uncircumcised, was not said to be debarred from entering,
but was to be &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; from the people which implies previous
covenant relationship.</p>
<p>But all this is reversed under the new covenant. No one
nation is chosen, but the people of the covenant are to be
those who respond to a call made to all nations. No family
is chosen, but the blessing is offered to each of all the families
of earth. No infant is either invited or excluded, except
as it comes to faith in, and obedience to, the Son of God.
The covenant blessings are not national and eternal, based
upon a living and active faith. As a consequence, infants are
not, and could not possibly be embraced in the new covenant;
and as the Church of Christ, as to its divinely-ordained membership,
consists of those who have thus believed in him,
infants are not and can not be in the Church of Christ, therefore
are not subjects of baptism, for all who are Scripturally
baptized enter into the church.</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to the remaining methods
by which the practice of infant baptism could be proven.
They are: (1) Express command of an inspired man; or,
(2) by an example from Scripture where an inspired man
baptized infants, or where it was done in his presence, by his
consent and approval. Inasmuch as it is admitted by renowned
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
pedobaptists that there is neither express command
for or example of infant baptism in the New Testament, I
will make no attempt to answer the arguments to prove it,
but let the most learned of their number speak for themselves.
This is legitimate and has the divine sanction, for
Jesus said: &ldquo;Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee&rdquo;
(Luke 19:22); and Paul, in meeting opposition to his preaching,
said: &ldquo;As certain even of your own poets have said&rdquo;
(Acts 17:28); and again: &ldquo;One of themselves, a prophet
of their own, said&rdquo; (Titus 1:12).</p>
<p>Henry Alford, one of the most variously-learned clergymen
that the Church of England has produced, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language of the Bible is against them; and, on their
own ground, which is a very sore perplexity. There is one
escape, and that is a perfectly effectual one; but they are unwilling
to avail themselves of its assistance. They might declare,
and they ought to declare, that infant baptism was a
practice unknown to the apostles; that not only does the New
Testament not give one single expression which plainly and
necessarily implies that infants were baptized in the apostolical
churches, but it can be fairly argued from a passage in chapter
7 of II Corinthians 7 that such a practice could not have existed
at Corinth. The recognition that the baptism of adults was
the only baptism known to the apostles would clear every
difficulty on this point out of the way of the Low Churchmen.
It is natural that the sacred writers should assume that men
who, at great worldly sacrifice, not free from risk of life,
came forward to profess the Christian faith by a solemn initiatory
rite, possessed the frame of mind which that fact implied&mdash;that
they were honestly changed and renewed beings. And
then it would be easy to pass on the conclusion that the baptismal
service of the Church of England has been constructed
on the language of the Bible, and that the embarrassment has
proceeded not from a mistaken view of baptism, but from the
application of the words used by Scripture of an adult person
to an unconscious and, so to say, mindless infant. (Contemporary
Review, Vol. 10, page 329.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph Ager Beet, one of the finest scholars that the
English Wesleyan Methodist Church has produced, Professor
of Systematic Theology in the Wesleyan Theological
College, Richmond, England, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be at once admitted that the New Testament contains
no clear proof that infants were baptized in the days
of the apostles. (Christian Baptism, page 28.)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Albert Taylor Bledsoe, of whom it has been truthfully
said, &ldquo;He was one of the most candid and trustworthy writers
that the Methodist Church has produced,&rdquo; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an article of our faith, that &ldquo;the baptism of young
children (infants) is in any wise to be retained in the church,
as one most agreeable to the institution of Christ.&rdquo; But yet,
with all our searching, we have been unable to find, in the New
Testament, a single express declaration, or word, in favor of
infant baptism. We justify this rite, therefore, solely on the
ground of logical inference, and not on any express word of
Christ or his apostles. This may, perhaps, be deemed, by
some of our readers, a strange position for a pedobaptist. It
is by no means, however, a singular opinion. Hundreds of
learned pedobaptists have come to the same conclusion; especially
since the New Testament has been subjected to a
closer, more conscientious, and more candid exegesis than was
formerly practiced by controversalists. (Southern Review,
Vol. 14, page 334.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Calvin, the founder of the Presbyterian Church,
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Christ enjoins them to teach before baptizing, and
desires that none but believers shall be admitted to baptism,
it would appear that baptism is not properly administered
unless when preceded by faith. (Harmony of the Evangelists,
Vol. 3, page 38.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heinrich August Wilhelm Meyer, German Lutheran, the
&ldquo;prince of New Testament exegetes,&rdquo; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The baptism of the children of Christians, of which no trace
is found in the New Testament, is not to be held as an apostolic
ordinance; but it is an institution of the church, which
gradually arose in post-apostolic times in connection with the
development of ecclesiastical life and of doctrinal teaching,
not certainly attested before Tertullian, and by him still decidedly
opposed, and although already defended by Cyprian,
only becoming general after the time of Augustine in virtue
of that connection. (Commentary on Acts 16:15, page 312.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>August Wilhelm Neander, Lutheran, who is unanimously
conceded to be by far the greatest of all ecclesiastical historians,
and is surnamed &ldquo;the father of modern church history,&rdquo;
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baptism was administered at first only to adults, as men
were accustomed to conceive baptism and faith as strictly
connected. We have all reason for not deriving infant baptism
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
from apostolic institution somewhat later, as an apostolical
tradition serves to confirm this hypothesis. (Church History,
Vol. 1, page 424.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moses Stuart, a Congregationalist, called &ldquo;the father of
Biblical literature in America&rdquo;, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the subject of infant baptism I have said nothing.
The present occasion did not call for it; and I have no wish
or intention to enter into the controversy respecting it. I
have only to say that I believe in both the propriety and expediency
of the rite thus administered; and therefore accede to
it ex animo. Commands, or plain and certain examples, in
the New Testament relative to it, I do not find. Nor, with
my views of it, do I need them. (Mode of Christian Baptism,
pages 189, 190.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have given enough; it is a thing made out that
infant baptism was not an apostolic practice. So, indeed,
have all the scholars who have thoroughly investigated this
subject conceded. I know of no subject which seems to be
more clearly made out, and I can not see how it is possible for
any candid man who examines the subject to deny this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h3 id="c5">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="h3line2">CONDITIONS OF MEMBERSHIP</span></h3>
<p>As we have already learned that infant baptism was
not an apostolic practice, we will give it no further attention
at present. The conditions of membership in the apostolic
Church naturally divide themselves into two classes&mdash;those
of admission into the Church and those of continued
membership.</p>
<h4 id="c6">CONDITIONS OF ADMISSION</h4>
<p>Concerning admission into the Church it is said in connection
with its establishment that &ldquo;the Lord added to them
day by day those that were saved&rdquo; (Acts 2:47). This
implies that the Lord saved the people and added them by
one and the same process. They were not first saved and
then added, nor added and afterward saved, but they were
saved in being added, and added by being saved. Hence
it was not a formal adding to a local congregation by extending
the &ldquo;hand of fellowship&rdquo; after salvation from sin, but
an adding to the one body of Christ in the obtaining of
salvation by obedience to the Gospel. While they were
added by the Lord, he added them through certain agencies,
both human and divine&mdash;the Holy Spirit, the Gospel and the
preacher&mdash;all present and active in the work. What the
Lord did, therefore, he did through these agencies.</p>
<p>In the second chapter of Acts the Holy Spirit gives the
directions that God gave to guide sinners into the Church.
This being the first time that men were guided into the
Church, the directions given would necessarily be more
minute and particular in every step than after the way was
fully made known to men.</p>
<p>After his resurrection from the dead Jesus said to his
disciples, &ldquo;All authority hath been given unto me in heaven
and on earth,&rdquo; to show them that he had the right and
authority to speak the words that come next: &ldquo;Go ye,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always,
even unto the end of the world&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19, 20). They
were not to go yet, for he had sealed their lips. On the
day of his ascension to heaven he said unto them: &ldquo;Go ye
into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but
he that disbelieveth shall be condemned&rdquo; (Mark 16:15, 16);
&ldquo;but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power
from on high&rdquo; (Luke 24:49). So they returned to Jerusalem
and waited for the coming of the Spirit who was to
unseal their lips and to speak to the world in the name of
Jesus. The day of Pentecost came, they were in the temple,
when suddenly a sound from heaven filled the house where
they were sitting, and they felt themselves moved inwardly
by a new power, under which they began to speak to the
multitude in the temple, addressing them in all the different
languages represented by the nations there assembled. The
time had come when they can tell to the world all they
know about Jesus fully and freely. And when they had
praised God, to the amazement of the people, in all their
tongues, Peter arose, now having the keys to the kingdom
in his hands, now ready to execute his high commission to
open the gates and admit those who were entitled to enter,
and for the first time in his life begins to inform men who
Jesus is. He delivers a discourse in which he says: &ldquo;Ye
men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man
approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders
and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even
as ye yourselves know; him, being delivered by the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hands
of lawless men did crucify and slay: whom God raised up,
having loosed the pangs of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quotes language of the prophets to prove this. He
then presents the testimony of himself and his fellow apostles
to the effect that Jesus had been raised from the dead,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and that they had seen him with their eyes and handled him
with their hands. He further states that God had said to
Jesus: &ldquo;Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
enemies the footstool of thy feet,&rdquo; and closes this powerful
argument with this soul-stirring appeal: &ldquo;Let all the house
of Israel therefore know assuredly that God hath made him
both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three thousand of those who stood in the hearing of
Peter&rsquo;s voice believed this, felt pricked in their hearts&mdash;that
sense of guilt which overwhelmed them when they
realized that they had been guilty of murdering the Son of
the living God, the greatest crime that human being ever
committed&mdash;and in great agony of soul, they cried out:
&ldquo;Brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo; to get rid of this pricking
of our hearts, to get rid of the awful crime, to get rid of
our sins before God and escape its consequences in the day
of God&rsquo;s wrath against sin.</p>
<p>Moved by the Holy Spirit, Peter answered: &ldquo;Repent
ye, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This was God&rsquo;s answer, that
enabled them to get rid of their guilt and condemnation at
once. And to assure them still further, he said: &ldquo;For to
you is the promise&rdquo; (the remission of sins and the gift of
the Holy Spirit), &ldquo;and to your children, and to all that are
afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto
him,&rdquo; for the commission was to &ldquo;all nations,&rdquo; &ldquo;even unto
the end of the world.&rdquo; But Peter did not stop here, for
&ldquo;with many other words he testified, and exhorted them,
saying, &lsquo;Save yourselves from this crooked generation.&rsquo;
Then they that received his word were baptized; and there
were added unto them in that day about three thousand
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, let us see if we can gather from this brief narrative
what agencies God used in bringing about the conversion of
these people, and what conditions they had to comply with
in order to receive the benefits of the redemption which was
provided by the blood of Christ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h4 id="c7">AGENCIES</h4>
<p>1. The Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>2. The apostles, speaking as the Spirit gave them utterance,
testifying of the Christ and pleading with sinners,
were the leading human agents in this case of conversion,
as they are still and ever will be; for though dead they yet
speak through the Gospel which they first preached through
the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven. As they were agents
then through their spoken testimony, so they are agents now
through their written testimony. Their words live in all
their vitalizing power, and can never be destroyed.</p>
<p>3. The sinners themselves, guilt-stricken and inquiring,
had also an agency in this work which so vitally concerned
themselves. It was theirs to attend to the things spoken
by the apostles, to hearken to the divine counsel, to learn of
Jesus, and to receive the truth that they might be made alive.
They had the divinely-given power to do this; and they also
had the power to reject the Gospel and die, otherwise the
apostle could not say, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this crooked
generation&rdquo;&mdash;seize the help God was holding out from
heaven.</p>
<h4 id="c8">CONDITIONS</h4>
<p>1. They heard (vs. 8, 11, 14, 22, 37).</p>
<p>2. Believed (vs. 30), in accordance with the apostle&rsquo;s
appeal to them, otherwise they would not have been pricked
in their hearts.</p>
<p>3. They repented.</p>
<p>4. Were baptized in his name. Thus they entered
through these divinely-appointed conditions into the enjoyment
of the blessings graciously provided for them through
the death and mediation.</p>
<p>This was the first time the Gospel in its fullness was
ever preached under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, leading
men into the Church of God and into the remission of
their sins, under the world-wide commission of Jesus, the
Lord and Master; for Peter, in giving an account of the
conversion of Cornelius, said: &ldquo;As I began to speak, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning&rdquo;
(Acts 11:15). On the first occasion, when the world
knew not the way, there was of necessity a demand for a
fullness and specificness of direction, a careful and distinct
enumeration of the steps to be taken in their connection,
and the agencies used, that was not needful in after references;
after the steps to be taken and the order was once
clearly made known, an allusion to one leading step or point
or the order called up all of them. These were the steps
to be taken, this the rule to be followed, the fixed directions
of the spirit of God, sealed by the blood of Christ, worldwide
in its application, and to stand to the end of the world.
No human power can abrogate, change or modify this commission
of the Lord Jesus, this guidance of the Spirit; and
I feel sure that no one can have a well-grounded assurance
of citizenship in that kingdom until he has complied with
the conditions presented in the blood-sealed commission of
Jesus Christ, given under the infallible guidance of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This brings us to the discussion of the second division
of the subject&mdash;</p>
<h4 id="c9">CONDITIONS OF CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP</h4>
<p>To all those who entered into the apostolic Church the
exhortation was given: &ldquo;Putting away, therefore, all
wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and
all evil speakings, as new-born babes, long for the spiritual
milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto
salvation&rdquo; (I Peter 2:1, 2). They were also taught to
&ldquo;let the word of Christ dwell in them richly&rdquo; (Col. 3:16).
This was necessary in the mind of inspired men because
they realized that to be a Christian was to be like God. It
was to be like God in the flesh. Jesus Christ was Immanuel&mdash;&ldquo;God
with us&rdquo; in the flesh. He came in the flesh to take
on himself all the feelings, temptations, and weaknesses of
humanity, to show what and how the Christian should live.
With this in mind it is easy to see that with them the Christian
was God growing in the flesh up to the stage of maturity
in man and perfection under &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of life
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In the growth of the Christian there was
a constant but gradual growth of all the desires and affections
into the likeness of the character affections that move
God; a growth in character in the feelings and in thoughts
and in actions to the life and character of God. The Christian&rsquo;s
life was a continual growth into a nobler life with
God. They were to grow in thoughts and feelings, in purposes
and actions, into the likeness of God. Solomon said:
&ldquo;For as he thinketh within himself, so is he&rdquo; (Prov. 23:7).
The thoughts and feelings that a man cherishes in his heart
mold and shape the character and make him what he is. A
spirit that loves as God loves and seeks to do good and bless
as God does will grow into the likeness of God. They were
taught that a man must not only think as God thinks; but
that the thoughts must grow into permanent principles
cherished in the heart; that they must mold the actions to
make him act as God acts. Faith in God made them desire
to think, feel and act like God, which is the end and accomplishment
of the turning to God.</p>
<p>But all who entered into the apostolic Church did not
choose to thus develop themselves into the likeness of God
and continue in the fellowship with him, for some were put
away. There were reasons for this. Since some were and
some were not, it follows that there were conditions of continued
fellowship. Some have interpreted the parable of
the tares (Matt. 13:24-30)&mdash;&ldquo;Let both grow together until
the harvest&rdquo;&mdash;to mean that there is to be no exclusion from
the Church, but this is to make parabolic language conflict
with plain, unfigurative statements and historical facts,
which is not admissible. The Saviour directed that he who
would not &ldquo;hear the church&rdquo; should be &ldquo;as the Gentile and
the publican&rdquo; (Matt. 18:17). Concerning the incestuous
man in the church at Corinth Paul said: &ldquo;For I verily,
being absent in the body but present in spirit, have already
as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought
this thing, in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered
together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus&rdquo; (I Cor. 5:3-5). And to the Thessalonians he gave
practically the same directions: &ldquo;Now we command you,
brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye
withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly&rdquo;
(II Thess. 3:6). The Holy Spirit mentions the
following things as the works of the flesh: &ldquo;Fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife,
jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties, envying,
drunkenness, revelings, and such like; of which I forewarn
you, that they who practice such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God&rdquo; (Gal. 5:10-21).</p>
<p>Those guilty of such things &ldquo;can not inherit the kingdom
of God.&rdquo; Such things are disorderly, else they would not
deprive one of the kingdom of God. For those that walk
orderly enjoy the divine favor. Since such things are disorderly,
and the Church is to withdraw from those who walk
disorderly, it follows that the Church is to withdraw from
all such. Therefore, the congregation that did not do it,
disregarded the law and authority of Jesus Christ. Of
course, it is understood that an earnest, faithful effort was
to be made to bring such offenders to repentance, and an
orderly life; but when such efforts failed, they were compelled
by the law of Christ to put them away. Consequently
the condition of continuing in the membership of the Church
of God was an orderly Christian life, as I have already
shown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3 id="c10">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE WORSHIP</span></h3>
<p>Of the people under the new covenant the Holy Spirit,
through Peter, said: &ldquo;But ye are an elect race, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God&rsquo;s own possession,
that ye may show the excellencies of him who called you
out of darkness into his marvelous light&rdquo; (I Peter 2:9).
They constitute a nation&mdash;not a republic, but a kingdom&mdash;so
we read: &ldquo;Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from
our sins by his blood; and he made us to be a kingdom, to
be priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory
and the dominion for ever and ever&rdquo; (Rev. 1:6, 7). &ldquo;And
madest them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests&rdquo;
(Rev. 5:10).</p>
<p>A nation or kingdom of priests is equal to a nation or
kingdom without priests. And so the whole Church of
God is his lot, heritage, &ldquo;clergy,&rdquo; or priesthood. As a
kingdom, not of this world, though in the world. When on
trial for his life, Jesus said: &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this
world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my
servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews;
but now is my kingdom not from hence&rdquo; (John 18:36).
Though on earth, not earthly, and its honors and grandeur
are not akin to those of the nations of this world. The
subjects of this &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; were born, &ldquo;not of blood, nor of
the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo;
(John 1:13); &ldquo;born of water and the Spirit.&rdquo; They were
all the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty.</p>
<p>Congregated for worship and service they were not only
a priesthood, but their edification was committed to the
whole body of male members, excluding from ministering
therein only those incapable of edifying. There were elders,
required to be &ldquo;apt to teach,&rdquo; not to be the sole instructors
of the church, but taking part therein; securing order and
propriety on the part of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Every member was taught to attend the worship regularly,
but this was not the end. Even if every member attended
regularly and punctually, this was not to be the end
of the teaching, the worship, the service. These were
necessary, because without these the end could not be attained.
The end was to excite and secure the active and
earnest labor of every member in serving God and teaching
and helping humanity. One could not serve God without
helping others. He was to help them spiritually, morally,
intellectually and materially. The end of all the teaching
and training of men in the church was that they might bear
fruit in doing good to men. Paul said of Christ Jesus: &ldquo;Who
gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own
possession, zealous of good works&rdquo; (Titus 2:14). They
were to cease to do evil and be zealous in good works.
&ldquo;Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire
that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have
believed in God may be careful to maintain good works.
These are good and profitable unto men.... And let
our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses, and that they be not unfruitful&rdquo; (Titus 3:8-14). The
end of the teaching and the worship was to develop the
activity and direct the energies of every member in good
works. The first element of true good to others was to
bring them into proper spiritual relations to God, for without
this no good can be enjoyed. But this spiritual harmony
with God must show itself in bringing every thought into
harmony with the will of God and so direct the bodily
energies as to bring all good&mdash;spiritual, intellectual and
material&mdash;to all creatures.</p>
<p>Every member of the Church was to participate in all
the services of the church; and the members not only were
competent to do all the work pertaining to the church, but
they needed this work and service for their own spiritual
growth. In this service alone could the Christian find the
food and exercise needed for his growing wise and strong
in the inner man. The spiritual man could no more grow
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
strong and active without himself doing the worship and
work of the church than the body could grow strong while
refusing the food and exercise needed for its growth and
life. In this service in the church man could alone find the
highest development of the soul and the mind and the body.
One could no more worship and do the work in the church
by proxy and grow spiritually thereby than he could eat and
take exercise by proxy and his body grow thereby. The
well-being of every member demanded that he should take
active part in the worship, the well-being of the church demanded
the help of every member that it &ldquo;may grow up in
all things unto him, who is the head, even Christ; from
whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through
that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in
due measure of each several part, making the increase of
the body unto the building up of itself in love&rdquo; (Eph. 4:15, 16).
The point emphasized here is that every member had
his work to do, his office to fill, and by this harmonious
working of all the parts the body grew into the well-proportioned
body of Christ&mdash;the Church. The welfare and
development of the whole was dependent upon the proper
workings of each and every member.</p>
<p>Every child of God, by virtue of his birthright into God&rsquo;s
family, a family of priests to God, had the right to perform
any and every service connected with the Church of God,
limited only by God&rsquo;s directions and by the ability to do it
decently and in order. All were encouraged to take part
in the service, and in doing the service each member manifested
his talent for the work and trained himself for fitness
in God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Every dispensation has had its peculiar worship. That
of the Jewish dispensation differed from the patriarchal.
The worship under the Christian dispensation is radically
different from both. The worship which was acceptable
under the patriarchal would condemn a Jew; and that which
would justify a Jew would condemn a Christian. During
the patriarchal dispensation religion was confined to the
family. Every one was his own priest, and he could build
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
his own altar and offer his own sacrifices for himself and
for his family. (Gen. 4:4; 8:20; Job. 1:5.) But when
the priesthood was changed, and confined to the family of
Levi (Ex. 28:1; Num. 25:11-13), this worship was no
longer permitted by those included in the Sinaitic covenant;
hence no longer acceptable. It is likewise true that the
sacrifices offered by the Levitical priesthood ceased to be
acceptable after the death of Christ and the establishment
of the Church. When Christ ascended to the Father the
priesthood was changed. The high priesthood then passed
into the hands of one belonging &ldquo;to another tribe, from
which no man hath given attendance at the altar. For it is
evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which
tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests&rdquo; (Heb. 7:13, 14).
The priesthood being changed, a change of the
Worship follows as a necessity. &ldquo;For the priesthood being
changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the
law&rdquo; (Heb. 7:12). While the worship of the three dispensations
had some things in common, each had its distinctive
peculiarities. Since Christianity is distinguished
from every other religion by its institutions and worship, it
of necessity follows that, in order to its preservation, these
must be strictly observed. Nothing short of this can preserve
the Church from degeneracy and final extinction. As
we have already learned, a fundamental feature of the worship
in the Church of God is the <i>Universal Priesthood</i> of
its membership. All the members of God&rsquo;s family have
became &ldquo;a royal priesthood,&rdquo; who no longer offer bloody
sacrifices of the law of Moses, but they offer their &ldquo;bodies
a living sacrifice&rdquo; (Rom. 12:1), and the &ldquo;sacrifice of praise
to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make
confession to his name&rdquo; (Heb. 13:15). Since all were
priests, all worshiped God without any mediatorship other
than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. They could all come
with equal boldness to the throne of grace. Such clerical
distinction and arrogance as we have at the present time had
no place then.</p>
<p>That the apostles taught the churches to do all the Lord
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
commanded will not be called in question by those who
receive the Bible as authority. Whatever, then, the churches
did by the appointment or concurrence of the apostles, they
did by the commandment of Jesus Christ. Whatever acts
of worship the apostles taught and sanctioned in one congregation,
they taught and sanctioned in all, because all
under the same government of the same King. But the
church in Troas met &ldquo;upon the first day of the week ...
to break bread&rdquo; (Acts 20:7), and Paul exhorts the Hebrew
brethren to &ldquo;consider one another to provoke unto love and
good works; not forsaking our own assembling together, as
the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so
much the more as ye see the day drawing nigh&rdquo; (Heb. 10:24, 25).
From the manner in which this meeting of the
disciples at Troas is mentioned by Luke, two things are
very evident: (1) That it was an established rule of the
disciples to meet on the first day of the week; (2) that the
primary object of their meeting was to break bread. And
Luke also tells us that the Jerusalem church &ldquo;continued
steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread and prayers&rdquo; (Acts 2:42), which shows
us that the breaking of bread was a prominent item in those
stated meetings. Other corroborating evidences of the
stated meetings on the first day of the week for religious
purposes are indicated by the instructions Paul gave to the
church in Galatia and Corinth: &ldquo;Now concerning the collection
for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of
Galatia, so also do ye. Upon the first day of the week let
each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that
no collections be made when I come&rdquo; (I Cor. 16:1, 2).</p>
<p>As we have seen that whatever the primitive churches did
by the approval of the apostles, they did by divine authority,
now, as Paul approved their meeting on the first day of the
week, it is as high authority as could be required for the
practice of meeting to worship on the first day of every
week. The items of their worship were:</p>
<h4 id="c11">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING</h4>
<p>They believed that the teaching of the apostles was from
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
God and they constantly and diligently studied it, that they
might know and do the whole will of God. The constant
study of and the profound reverence for the Word of God
were recognized traits of their character. They certainly
had the word of Christ dwelling in them richly. Not only
was reading the Scriptures a part of all the public worship,
it was a daily custom in private life&mdash;in the family, the
social circle, and even at their toil. On this point I will give
the testimony of Lyman Coleman, who has gathered much
information on this subject. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No trait of the primitive Christians was more remarkable
than their profound reverence for the Scriptures and their
diligent study of them. The Word of God, dwelling in them
richly and abounding, was their meditation all the day long.
Those who could read never went abroad without taking some
part of the Bible with them. The women, in their household
labors, wore some portion of the sacred roll hanging about their
necks; and the men made it the companion of their toil in the
field and the workshop. Morning, noon and night they read
it at their meals. By the recitals of the narratives of sacred
history, by constant reading, by paraphrase, by commentary,
and by sacred song, they taught the Scriptures diligently unto
their children; talked of these heavenly themes when they sat
in their house, when they walked by the way, when they laid
themselves down, and when they rose up. One relates with
great delight that he never sat at meat with Origen, A. D. 225,
but one of the company read to the other. They never retired
to rest without first reading the Bible. So diligent were they
in this divine employment that &ldquo;prayers succeeded reading of
the Word, and the reading of the Word to prayer.&rdquo; (Ancient
Christianity Exemplified, Page 57.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Augustus Neander says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nature of single acts of Christian worship will be
evident from what we have remarked respecting its essence
generally. As the elevation of the spirit and heart of the
united Church of God was the end of the whole, so instruction
and edification by uniting in the common contemplation of the
divine Word, constituted, from the first, a principal part of
Christian worship. The mode in which this was done might,
like the form of the church constitution, be closely connected
with the arrangement of the assemblies of the Jewish communities
in the synagogues. As in the synagogue assemblies
of the Jews the reading of portions from the Old Testament
formed the basis of religious instruction, so the same practice
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
passed over into the Christian assemblies. The Old Testament
was read first, particularly the prophetic parts of it, as referring
to the Messiah; next, the gospels, and finally the apostolic
epistles. The reading of the Scriptures was of the greater
consequence, since it was desired to make every Christian
familiar with them. (History of the Christian Church, Vol. 1,
Page 412.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c12">THE FELLOWSHIP</h4>
<p>The leading idea of this term is that of joint participation.
We have fellowship with God because we are made
partakers of the divine nature, as we escape the corruption
that is in the world through lust. We have fellowship with
Jesus Christ because of the common sympathies which his
life and sufferings have established between himself and us.
To be in fellowship with him means to take part in his
poverty and want, to share in his sorrows, his sufferings
and self-denial in this world, as well as to partake of the
joys and hopes, the consolations and blessedness of this
world, and the hopes and glories of the world to come. We
have fellowship with one another because of the mutual
participation in each other&rsquo;s affections, joys, sorrows and
needs. The word as here used includes the contribution
which was regularly made on the first day of every week.
Paul says: &ldquo;Upon the first day of the week let each one
of you lay by him in store as he may prosper&rdquo; (I Cor. 16:2).
The small offering of the poor was as much demanded
as the greater ones of the rich, and just as acceptable. The
regulation governing this was: &ldquo;For if the readiness is
there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according
as he hath not&rdquo; (II Cor. 8:12). God never valued the
offerings brought to him by their intrinsic value, but by the
sacrifice made by the one making the offering. It was also
required that the worshiper should be liberal and cheerful
in giving. &ldquo;He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly;
and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
Let each man do as he hath purposed in his heart;
not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful
giver&rdquo; (II Cor. 9:6, 7). This shows that a cheerful,
bountiful offering to God is but a reasonable measure of
liberality. God expected this of every worshiper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h4 id="c13">BREAKING BREAD</h4>
<p>That the churches in apostolic times met on the first day
of every week to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is well at
tested by both inspired and uninspired writers. It is plainly
stated that the disciples at Troas gathered together to break
bread; and what one church did by the authority of the Lord,
as a part of his instituted worship, they all did. That they
met for this purpose is not to be inferred, for Luke says:
&ldquo;And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered
together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending
to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until
midnight&rdquo; (Acts 20:7). From the way this meeting is
mentioned two things are quite obvious: (1) That it was
an established custom for the disciples to meet on the first
day of the week; and (2) that the primary object of this
meeting was to break bread.</p>
<p>All Biblical scholars and church historians, without regard
to denomination, generally concede that the apostolic
church observed the Lord&rsquo;s Supper on the first day of every
week. Out of the many proofs that might be given of
this I will give the testimony of only one. Mosheim says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of all the Christian churches founded by the
apostles was that of Jerusalem; and after the form and model
of this, all the others of that age were constituted. That
Church, however, was governed immediately by the apostles,
to whom the presbyters and the deacons, or overseers of the
poor, were subject. Though the people had not withdrawn
themselves from the Jewish worship, yet they held their own
separate meetings, in which they were instructed by the apostles
and presbyters, offered up their united prayers, celebrated
the sacred supper, the memorial of Jesus Christ, of his death,
and the salvation he procured.... The Christians of this
century assembled for the worship of God and for their advancement
in piety on the first day of the week, the day on
which Christ reassumed his life; for that this day was set
apart for religious worship by the apostles themselves, and
that, after the example of the Church of Jerusalem, it was
generally observed we have unexceptional testimony. (Ecclesiastical
History, Vol. I, page 46, 85.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This testimony is confirmed by the pagan Pliny in his
well-known letter to Trajan (about A. D. 100), written
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
while he presided over Pontus and Bithynia. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christians affirm the whole of their guilt or error to
be that they were accustomed to meet together on a stated day,
before it was light, and to sing hymns to Christ as a god, and
to bind themselves by a sacrimentum, not for any wicked purpose,
but never to commit fraud, theft, or adultery; never to
break their word or to refuse, when called upon, to deliver up
any trust; after which it was their custom to separate, and to
assemble again to take a meal, but a general one, and without
guilty purpose. (Epistle X, 97.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c14">PRAYERS</h4>
<p>Simplicity characterized everything in the primitive
worship. Consequently the prayers of the first Christians
were of the most simple and artless character. They regarded
prayer as a quickening spirit, drawing forth the
inward inspirations of the soul after God, and accompanied
every important act of their public and private life with
this holy privilege, and Paul exhorts his readers to &ldquo;pray
without ceasing.&rdquo; On this subject Lyman Coleman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prayers of the Church were offered in language the
most artless and natural. Even the most learned of the
apologists and early fathers, such as Justin Martyr, Theophilus
of Antioch, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Arnobius, and Lactantius, who were no strangers to the graces
of diction, refused all ornamental embellishments in their addresses
to the throne of grace, alleging that the kingdom of
heaven consists not in words, but in power. Their prayers
were accordingly offered in the greatest simplicity, and as far
as possible in the phraseology of Scripture. This artlessness
and elegant simplicity appears in striking contrast with the
ostentation and bombast of a later date. This contrast appears
equally great also in the brevity of these prayers. It
was a maxim of the primitive Church that many words should
never be employed to express what might be better said in a
few. (Ibid, page 316.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c15">SINGING</h4>
<p>Their singing was a real heartfelt service. The Holy
Spirit said: &ldquo;And be not drunken with wine, wherein is
riot, but be filled with the Spirit; speaking to one another in
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making
melody with your hearts to the Lord&rdquo; (Eph. 5:18, 19).
And again, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly;
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace
in your hearts unto God&rdquo; (Col. 3:16). In this delightful
service the whole congregation doubtless took part. It has
been contended, recently, that the singing of the first
churches was not congregational, and therefore our congregational
singing is as unscriptural and unauthorized as any
musical performance in the worship. The testimony of
history is against this statement. On this subject Philip
Schaff says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The song, a form of prayer, in the festive dress of pietry
and the elevated language of inspiration, raising the congregation
to the highest pitch of devotion, and giving it a part
in the heavenly harmonies of the saints. This passed immediately,
with psalms of the Old Testament, those inexhaustible
treasures of spiritual experience, edification and comfort,
from the temple and the synagogue into the Christian
Church. The Lord himself inaugurated psalmody into the
new covenant at the institution of the holy Supper, and Paul
expressly enjoined the singing of &ldquo;psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs&rdquo; as a means of social edification. (History of the
Christian Church, Vol. I, page 463.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the same effect testifies Lyman Coleman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prevailing mode of singing during the first three
centuries was congregational. The whole congregation united
their voices in the sacred song of praise, in strains suited to
their ability. Their music, if such it could be called, was, of
necessity, crude and simple. Indeed, it appears to have been
a kind of recitative or chant. The charm of their sacred music
was not in the harmony of sweet sounds, but in the melody of
the heart.... But, however this may be, the most ancient
and most common mode of singing was confessedly for the
whole assembly; men, women and children blend their voices
in their songs of praise in the great congregation. Such is the
testimony of Hillary, of Augustin and Chrysostom. &ldquo;Formerly
all came together and united in their song, as is still
our custom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Men and women, the aged and the young, were
distinguished only by their skill in singing, for the spirit which
led the voice of each one blended all in one harmonious melody.&rdquo;
(Ancient Christianity Exemplified, pages 329, 330.)</p>

<h3 id="c16">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="h3line2">POLITY</span></h3>
<p>By the term polity I mean the organic structure and government
of the Church. Nothing is more obvious from the
New Testament record than the simplicity which characterized
its primitive organization. In this particular
Christianity was in marked contrast with Judaism. With
temple, tabernacle or altars; without priests or Levites, and
almost without ceremonies, it made known at once its character
and purpose as spiritual and not carnal, as, in fact, a
kingdom of God &ldquo;not of this world.&rdquo; Its only authority
was</p>
<h4 id="c17">THE WORD OF GOD</h4>
<p>We have already seen that the only creed of the primitive
Church was the central truth of God&rsquo;s revelation to man&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; The
whole New Testament is but an expansion of this thought.
The early Christians, in confessing their faith in Christ,
accepted the whole revelation of God based upon it as their
absolute and only authority. The teaching of inspired men
was to them what the New Testament is to us, till their
teaching was recorded and the necessity for oral inspiration
ceased.</p>
<p>The all-sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures is thus expressed
by the inspired apostle: &ldquo;Every scripture inspired
of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction which is in righteousness: for the
man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto
every good work&rdquo; (II Tim. 3:16, 17). This most evidently
refers to the Old Testament as a whole&mdash;the book that
Timothy had known from his childhood. The teaching of
Jesus and the apostles in connection with the examples, the
teachings, the warnings of the Old Testament Scriptures,
are sufficient to thoroughly furnish the man of God with
instruction necessary to carrying out all the requirements
of God in every relationship of life. Paul&rsquo;s confidence in
the sufficiency of the Word of God is also expressed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
these words: &ldquo;And now I commend you to God, and to
the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and
to give the inheritance among them that are sanctified&rdquo;
(Acts 20:32). In the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, just before his arrest
and tragic death, he said: &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; thy
word is truth&rdquo; (John 17:17).</p>
<p>From what is here stated it is evident that the early
Christians were fully convinced that the Word of God in
the work of redemption was all-sufficient for the accomplishment
of the following things: (1) Teaching. (2) Reproof&mdash;conviction
of sin. (3) Correction&mdash;for setting men upright.
(4) Instruction in righteousness. (5) Build men
up. (6) Sanctification. (7) Give an inheritance. (8) And
perfection in good works.</p>
<p>Since the Bible furnishes all this, it would be difficult
to conceive any want it does not supply. It leaves no room
for a human creed, nor any other authority in matters of
faith. Hence it is a fact, conceded by all Biblical students,
that the apostolic Church accepted the Word of God as its
absolute and only authority in all religious affairs.</p>
<h4 id="c18">NAMES</h4>
<p>Those who became followers of Christ in the early days
of Christianity were designated by several names, all of
which were significant. They were called &ldquo;saints&rdquo; because
they had been set apart to the service of God; &ldquo;brethren,&rdquo;
because of their relation as members of a common family;
&ldquo;elect&rdquo; because they were chosen of God in Christ by the
Gospel; &ldquo;children of God,&rdquo; because of their relation to him
as a common Father; &ldquo;believers,&rdquo; because of their devotion
to Christ and of their faith in him; &ldquo;disciples,&rdquo; because they
were learners in the school of their Master; &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo;
because they were followers of Christ and citizens of his
kingdom. It was natural, therefore, that the last name
should soon become the most prominent and be freely used
by the friend and foe in times of persecution. Peter says:
&ldquo;If a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
but let him glorify God in this name&rdquo; (I Peter 4:16). It
was the name that united believers in the government of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Christ, and was the most comprehensive of all the names
of those given to those who composed the body of Christ.
To be called a Christian carried with it all the honors implied
in all the other names. All these names were worn by
divine authority, and were evidently given by inspiration.</p>
<h4 id="c19">CONGREGATIONAL INDEPENDENCE</h4>
<p>Each congregation was independent of all others in its
government. They sustained a fraternal relation to each
other as parts of the body of Christ, but no one was under
the ecclesiastical authority of another. There is no ecclesiastical
authority recognized in the New Testament except
that of a single congregation, and that only when acting
strictly in obedience to the will of Christ. From such a
decision there is no court of appeal. On this point I submit
the testimony of a few distinguished men, who, while
they stood identified with an eccleciasticism ruling the individual
congregation, admit that no such thing was known
to the New Testament. Mosheim says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the churches, in those primitive times, were independent
bodies; or none of them subject to the jurisdiction of
any other. For though the churches which were founded by
the apostles themselves frequently had the honor shown them
to be consulted in difficult and doubtful cases, yet they had
no judicial authority, no control, no power of giving laws.
On the contrary, it is as clear as the noon-day, that all Christian
churches had equal rights, and were in all respects on a
footing of equality. Nor does there appear in this first century
any vestige of that consociation of the churches of the
same provinces, which gave rise to ecclesiastical councils, and
to metropolitans. But, rather as is manifest, it was not till
the second century that the custom of holding ecclesiastical
councils first began in Greece, and thence extended into other
provinces. (Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 1, page 72.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning the churches of the second century, Mosheim
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a great part of this century, all churches continued
to be as at first, independent of each other, or were connected
by no consociation or confederation. Each church was
a kind of small independent republic, governing itself by its
own laws, enacted or at least sanctioned by the people. But
in the process of time it became customary for all the Christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
churches within the same province to unite and form a
sort of larger society or commonwealth; and in the manner
of confederated republics, to hold their conventions at stated
times, and there deliberate for the common advantage of the
whole confederation. (Ibid, page 116.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the independence of the apostolic churches, Prof.
Lyman Coleman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These churches, whenever formed, became separate and
independent bodies, competent to appoint their own officers,
and to administer their own government without reference to
subordination to any central authority or foreign power. No
fact connected with the history of these primitive churches is
more fully established or more generally conceded, so that the
discussion of it need not be renewed at this place. (Ancient
Christianity Exemplified, page 95.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we learn: (1) That during the first century
and the early part of the second the churches were independent;
and (2) that so soon as they confederated for the
common interest their independency was destroyed and a
tyrannical ecclesiasticism established. Much more might be
given to establish the face of the congregational independence
of the apostolic churches, but as that is so well established
and so generally admitted, it does not seem necessary.</p>
<h4 id="c20">ELDERS</h4>
<p>In every fully-developed church in apostolic times there
was a plurality of elders or bishops. Luke says: &ldquo;And
from Miletus he [Paul] sent to Ephesus, and called to him
the elders of the church. And when they were come to him
he said unto them, ... Take heed unto yourselves, and
to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you
bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased
with his own blood&rdquo; (Acts 20:17-28). From this we not
only learn that there was a plurality of elders at Ephesus,
but they were also called bishops, which clearly proves that
the terms &ldquo;elder&rdquo; and &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; are used synonymously.
Of Paul and Barnabas it is said: &ldquo;And when they had
preached the gospel to that city [Derbe], and had made
many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and
to Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples....
And when they had appointed for them elders in every
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them
to the Lord, on whom they had believed&rdquo; (Acts 14:21-23).
From this we learn that <i>elders</i> were appointed <i>in every
church</i>. That there were a plurality of elders in every fully-developed
church is abundantly proved by historical testimony.</p>
<p>The eldership is the most sacred trust of God to his
church. God is the legislator, the only lawmaker of his
people. His authority is absolute, his power omnipotent.
To the elders is committed the work of teaching and enforcing
the laws of God and of guarding them against all perversion
or corruption by adding to or taking from, or by
bringing in the customs, traditions, or doctrines of men.
No elder can be faithful to God without holding to the faithful
word which is according to the teaching, that he may be
able to &ldquo;exhort in sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers&rdquo;
(Titus 1:9). The Holy Spirit through Peter charges
them to &ldquo;tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising
the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according
to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready
mind; neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you,
but making yourselves ensamples to the flock&rdquo; (I Peter 5:2-4).
Their office is to feed the flock on &ldquo;the Spiritual milk
which is without guile that they may grow thereby unto
salvation.&rdquo; (See I Peter 2:2.) They are the guardians
of God&rsquo;s heritage, to keep it from being led away from him.</p>
<p>They are to make no rules of their own, as though they
are the lords or rulers over God&rsquo;s house. They have no
authority save to enforce the law of God, and so set an
example of fidelity to God to be followed by the church.
If elders conscientiously confine themselves to the law of
God, they can give account with joy; otherwise with grief.
The spirit in which this is to be done is given by Paul in his
charge to the elders at Ephesus: &ldquo;Take heed unto yourselves,
and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath
made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he
purchased with his own blood. I know that after my departing
grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
flock; and from among your own selves shall men arise,
speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three
years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with
tears, and now I commend you to God, and to the word of
his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you the
inheritance among all them that are sanctified&rdquo; (Acts 20:28-32).
This exhortation was given to guide the elders in
their work. A fundamental and all-pervading principle of
this counsel is that nothing is to be taught or practiced of
the precepts of man. The elders are to guard and preserve
the purity of God&rsquo;s word, the faith and peace of the church
and so promote the salvation of man.</p>
<p>Their labors were confined to the congregation in which
they held their membership, and to which they were responsible
for their conduct.</p>
<h4 id="c21">DEACONS</h4>
<p>There were also a plurality of deacons in every full-developed
congregation. Luke tells us (Acts 6:3) that
the Church in Jerusalem selected seven deacons. It is true
that they are not here called deacons, but the work to which
they were called corresponds to that of the deacons as described
by Paul in his letter to Timothy. The work of both
is expressed by the same word in the Greek. Paul addressed
a letter &ldquo;to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at
Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.&rdquo; Hence there were
a plurality in the Church at Philippi. This being true, and
Jerusalem being the Church after which the others were
modeled, I conclude that what was true of these churches
was true of all the others.</p>
<h4 id="c22">EVANGELISTS</h4>
<p>In the New Testament Church there was a class of
laborers called evangelists. Their work differed very materially
from that of the elders and deacons. Philip, who
was one of the seven that were appointed deacons in the
Church at Jerusalem, is the first evangelist of which we have
any account. He &ldquo;went down to the city of Samaria, and
proclaimed unto them the Christ. And the multitude gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by
Philip when they heard and saw the signs which he did....
[And] when they believed Philip preaching good
tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women&rdquo;
(Acts 8:5-12). Thence he went, in obedience to the instruction
of the angel, &ldquo;unto the way that goeth down from
Jerusalem unto Gaza,&rdquo; where he met &ldquo;a man of Ethiopia,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;preached unto him Jesus. And as they went on their
way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch said,
Behold here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?...
And they both went down into the water, both Philip
and the eunuch; and he baptized him.&rdquo; From this we learn
that a deacon may soon develop into an evangelist.</p>
<p>Timothy was exhorted to do the work of an evangelist;
hence it is legitimate to infer that he was one. From the
letters to Timothy and Titus it appears that the general work
of an evangelist was to preach the Gospel in other fields
than the congregation in which he held his membership,
establish churches and take care of them, appoint elders and
deacons when such work was appropriate, and to labor for
such congregations as needed assistance, whether with or
without an eldership.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2>PART II
<br />The Falling Away</h2>
<h3 id="c23">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE FALLING AWAY PREDICTED</span></h3>
<p>The Saviour, when about to leave his apostles, prayed
the Father, that as he till then had kept them, so they might
be kept when he was no longer personally with them, adding:
&ldquo;I pray not that thou shouldst take them from the
world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil one&rdquo;
(John 17:15). And his prayer was answered, for though
Jew and Gentile sought their death, yet they were preserved
until the church stood forth in the measure of the
stature of the fullness of Christ&mdash;till the perfect had come.
And what a perfection it was! Perfect unfolding of the
love of God, so far as that can be comprehended in this
life; perfect exhibition of the plan of salvation; perfect
deliverance of the faith; perfected canon of Scripture; perfected
church policy; perfected hope, blooming with immortality.
The last of the apostles were preserved to the
church till the entire apostolic work was done. The perfect
had thus come, and apostles were no more needed, and have
no more been had.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding perfection so varied, the world is
not yet brought to the Saviour. This would surprise us
did we not know that departure from the faith and order
has been as complete and widespread as could be. This sad
condition, however, did not come unawares upon the church,
for our Saviour himself, and his apostles, foretold the apostasy,
and so minutely that its very existence stands out that
prophets and apostles &ldquo;spake from God, being moved by the
Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Sermon on the Mount we have this solemn note of
warning: &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you
in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves....
By their fruits ye shall know them&rdquo; (Matt. 7:15-20).
These false prophets were men who would tear and
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
rend the sheep to satisfy their own greed; coming not only
as enemies, but &ldquo;in sheep&rsquo;s clothing,&rdquo; arising from among
the flock.</p>
<p>On careful examination it will be found that the apostles
never taught the disciples to look for an unbroken triumph
of Christianity. Paul gives warning to the Ephesian elders
concerning grievous wolves who would not spare the flock
in the following words: &ldquo;Take heed unto yourselves, to
feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his
own blood. I know that after my departing grievous wolves
shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; and from
your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things,
to draw away disciples after them&rdquo; (Acts 20:28-30).
These grievous, tearing wolves were to arise, not only in
the church, but from among the elders. They would care
for the fleece, not for the flock; speaking perverse things
to draw away from the truth of God. Paul&rsquo;s epistles repeat
the warning to the Ephesian elders in various and awful
forms. He wrote his second letter to the church in Thessalonica
for the express purpose of guarding the church
against the expected return of the Lord before the &ldquo;falling
away&rdquo; in the church, &ldquo;and the man of sin be revealed, the
son of perdition, he that opposeth and exalteth himself
against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that
he sitteth in the temple of God setting himself forth as God&rdquo;
(II Thess. 2:3, 4). In this it is clearly set forth that a
principle was at work in the church that would work out
developments and organizations that would set aside the
authority of God. The place or prerogative of God is to sit
as lawmaker, to make laws for his kingdom and his people,
and whoever or whatever proposes to legislate, make, repeal
or modify the laws of God, add to or take from what God
has said, is the man of sin, the son of perdition. Organizations
in the church or over the church to do the work that
God has committed to individual Christians and the churches
are the works of the man of sin.</p>
<p>Concerning false apostles Paul gave this warning: &ldquo;For
such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning
themselves into apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light&rdquo; (II
Cor. 11:12, 14). It was no wonder that false prophets
and apostate elders were transforming themselves into apostles
of Christ when their master was setting them the example.
All who sought to turn people from God&rsquo;s appointments
were ministers of Satan, even though they thought
they were serving God. The end of all such shall correspond
to their works. From this we learn a needful
warning in our day, that a man calling himself an apostle,
or the successor of the apostles, is no security that Satan
is not his prompter. No wonder, then, the apostasy came
soon and lasts long.</p>
<p>In the following the apostle again plainly foretells the
apostasy: &ldquo;But the Spirit expressly saith that in latter
times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy
of men that speak lies&rdquo; (II Tim. 4:1, 2). Every
one that teaches that man can in any manner set aside the
law and appointments of God, or substitute man&rsquo;s devices
for the order of God, is a seducing spirit that turns man
from the truth. Seducing spirits carry on their evil work
through men who speak lies in hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Again the apostle brings up the awful subject: &ldquo;But
know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, implacable, slanderous, without
self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, traitors, head-strong,
puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power
thereof: from these also turn away&rdquo; (II Tim. 3:1-5). The
condition here depicted was as certain as important. Timothy
was to have no doubt about it, and he was to be continually
calling it to mind. The men of the last times were
to be &ldquo;lovers of self&rdquo; and avaricious. Men had always been
so in all ages; but the characteristic of the men in question
was that they were to be &ldquo;holding a form of godliness,&rdquo; but
denying the power thereof.</p>
<p>But Paul is not the only one who confirms the prediction
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of the Lord. The whole body of the apostles are at
one on this point. James says: &ldquo;Whence come wars and
whence comes fightings among you? come they not hence,
even of your pleasures that war in your members? Ye
lust, and have not; ye kill, and covet, and can not obtain:
ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask
and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend
it on your pleasures&rdquo; (James 4:1-3). The wolfish work
had already begun; but it was little compared with what
was to follow, when the proud, money-loving priest would
find emperors and kings to arm in his quarrel. Peter, too,
writes: &ldquo;But there arose false prophets among the people,
as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall
privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master
that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
And many shall follow their lascivious doings;
by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken
of&rdquo; (II Peter 2:1, 2).</p>
<p>Jude also gives warning against the apostates predicted
by Christ, and Paul, and Peter, and denounced by James.
He says: &ldquo;For there are certain men crept in privily, even
who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation,
ungodly men, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness,
and denying our only Master, Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Jude
4). The self-styled vicar of Christ, with all his horde of
dignitaries, and all the multitude of corruptions in other
sectarian bodies, are sure that this can have no reference to
them, because they have never denied Christ; but on the
other hand have filled the world with their various creeds
and confessions of faith. But it deserves consideration,
whether works are not always more weighty than words.
&ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; is loathsome to him in the mouths of the
&ldquo;workers of iniquity&rdquo;; and Paul expressly declares that some
&ldquo;profess that they know God; but by their works they deny
him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every
good work reprobate&rdquo; (Titus 1:16).</p>
<p>Coming down to John, the last of the apostles, and, in
point of time, nearest to the apostasy, we read: &ldquo;Little
children, it is the last hour; and as ye heard that antichrist
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
cometh, even now have there risen many antichrists; whereby
we know that it is the last hour. They went out from
us, but they are not of us; for if they had been of us, they
would have continued with us; but they went out, that they
might be made manifest that they are not of us&rdquo; (I John 2:18, 19).
These antichrists were not open enemies, but
wolves in the garb of sheep. Then we read: &ldquo;Beloved,
believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they
are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into
the world&rdquo; (I John 4:1). Not into the world as openly
declaring their departure from the faith, but as destroyers
thereof by false doctrine, while professing to be servants
of Christ. Further: &ldquo;For many deceivers are gone forth
into the world, even they that confess not that Jesus Christ
cometh in the flesh.&rdquo; This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
They went forth into the world professedly as preachers of
the Gospel of Christ, yet denying his true character. Again:
&ldquo;I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who
loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us
not. Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance
his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked
words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself
receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and
casteth them out of the church&rdquo; (III John 9,10). Thus
this bloated wolf had acquired such power in the church as to
exclude those who held the truth as taught by the apostles.
In the last message that God ever made to man, he said:
&ldquo;To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things
saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he
that walketh in the midst of seven golden candlesticks: I
know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou
canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves
apostles, and they are not, and didst not find them
false&rdquo; (Rev. 2:1, 2). Thus it appears that what Paul
informed the elders of the church at Ephesus he knew would
come to pass after his leaving them. The wolves in that
case claimed to be the accepted apostles of Christ, but were
found liars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h3 id="c24">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE FALLING AWAY</span></h3>
<p>The origin of the Roman hierarchial system is obscured
in pious frauds; but it is certain that it arose gradually. As
we have already learned, the apostolic churches had a plurality
of elders or bishops. At the first the elders of any particular
congregation would select one of their number to
preside at their meetings for the transaction of business,
and in the course of time he came to be known as &ldquo;The
Bishop.&rdquo; Little by little he came to feel his importance till
he was exalted above his fellow elders. This the presbyters
would not concede. Divisions arose out of these troubles,
and the authority of the bishops, closely united among themselves,
came victorious over the presbyters, who opposed
them singlehanded. The power and authority of these
bishops were regulated by the prominence of the cities in
which they presided. As Rome was the chief city of the
world at that time, the bishops of cities of less importance
regarded it an honor to themselves to concede to the bishop
of Rome the pre-eminence in all things; and so he extended
his authority from time to time, till almost the whole world
bowed to his authority.</p>
<p>The changes which produced this condition are strikingly
expressed by Lyman Coleman. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. In the college of equal and co-ordinate presbyters, some
one would naturally act as moderator or presiding officer; age,
talent, influence, or ordination by the apostles, might give one
an accidental superiority over his fellows, and appropriate to
him the standing office of president of the presbytery. To this
office the title of bishop was assigned; and with the office and
the title began to be associated the authority of a distinct
order. Jerome alleges that the standing office and authority
of a bishop were a necessary expedient to still the cravings and
strife for preferment which by the instigation of Satan, arose in
process of time among the presbyters. Whatever may have
been the cause, a distinction began to be made, in the course
of the second century, between bishops and presbyters, which
finally resulted, in the century following, in the establishment
of the episcopal prerogatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>2. Without reference to the causes which occasioned the
distinction between the clergy and the laity, this is worthy of
notice as another important change in the constitution of the
Church, which gradually arose in connection with the rise of
episcopal power. In opposition to the idea of universal priesthood,
the people now became a distinct and inferior order.
They and the clergy begin to feel the force of conflicting interests
and claims, the distinction widens fast, and influence,
authority and power centralize in the bishop, the head of the
clerical order.</p>
<p>3. The clergy claim for themselves the prerogatives, relations
and authority of the Jewish priesthood. Such claims,
advanced in the third century by Cyprian, were a great departure
from the original spirit and model of the Church derived
from Christ and the apostles. It was falling back from the
New to the Old Testament, and substituting the outward for
the inward spirit. It presented the priesthood again as a
mediating office between man and his God. It sought to invest
the propitiating priest with awful sanctity, as the appointed
medium by which grace is imparted to man. Hence the necessity
of episcopal ordination, the apostolical succession, and the
grace of the ordinances administered by consecrated hands.
The clergy, by this assumption, were made independent of the
people; their commission and office were from God; and, as a
Mosaic priesthood, they soon began to claim an independent
sovereignty over the laity. &ldquo;God makes the priests&rdquo; was the
darling maxim of Cyprian, perpetually recurring in identical
and varied phraseology. No change, perhaps, in the whole
history of the changing forms of church government can be
specified more destructive to the primitive constitution of the
Church, or more disastrous to its spiritual interests. &ldquo;This
entire perversion of the original view of the Christian Church,&rdquo;
says Neander, &ldquo;was itself the origin of the whole system of the
Roman Catholic religion&mdash;the germ from which sprang the
popery of the Dark Ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Few and simple were the offices instituted in the Church
by the apostles; but after the rise of episcopacy, ecclesiastical
offices were multiplied with great rapidity. They arose, as
may appear in the progress of this work, from different causes
and at different times; many were the necessary results of
changes in the Church and in society; but, generally, they will
be found to have, as their ultimate effect and end, the aggrandizement
of the episcopate. They are an integral, if not an
essential, part of the ceremonial, the pomp and power of an
outward religion, that carnal perversion of the true idea of the
Christian Church, and the legitimate consequence of beginning
in the spirit and seeking to be made perfect in the flesh. (Ancient
Christianity Exemplified, pages 97-99.)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>This testimony is confirmed by Neander, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes which the constitution of the Christian Church
underwent during this period related especially to the following
particulars: (1) The distinction of bishops from presbyters,
and the gradual development of the monarchico-episcopal
church government; (2) The distinction of the clergy from the
laity, and the formation of a sacerdotal caste, as opposed to the
evangelical idea of the priesthood; (3) The multiplication of
church offices. (Church History, Vol. I, page 259.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it has been shown that episcopacy was the outgrowth
of a wicked ambition for leadership and power that
culminated in the papacy, I deem it important to give ample
proof, since it is yet very popular in many of the denominations
of this day. I now invite attention to the testimony
of Mosheim. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The form of church government which began to exist
in the preceding century was in this century more industriously
established and confirmed in all its parts. One president, or
bishop, presided over each church. He was created by the
common suffrage of the whole people. With presbyters for
his council, whose number was not fixed, it was his business to
watch over the interest of the whole Church, and to assign to
each presbyter his station. Subject to the bishop and also to
the presbyters were the servants or deacons, who were divided
into certain classes, because all the duties which the interests
of the Church required could not well be attended to by them all.</p>
<p>2. During a great portion of this century [second] all the
churches continued to be, as at first, independent of each other,
or were connected by no consociations or confederations. Each
church was a kind of small, independent republic, governing
itself by its own laws, enacted or at least sanctioned by the
people. But in the process of time it became customary for
all the Christian churches within the same province to unite and
form a sort of larger society or commonwealth; and in the manner
of confederated republics, to hold their conventions at stated
times, and there deliberate for the common advantage of the
whole confederation. This custom first arose among the
Greeks, with whom a political confederation of cities, and the
consequent convention of their several delegates, had been long
known; but afterward, the utility of the thing being seen, the
custom extended through all the countries where there were
Christian churches. Such conventions of delegates from several
churches assembled for deliberation were called by the
Greeks synods and by the Latins councils; and the laws agreed
upon in them were called canons, that is, rules.</p>
<p>3. These councils&mdash;of which no vestige appears before the
middle of this century&mdash;changed nearly the whole form of the
Church. For by them, in the first place, the ancient rights and
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
privileges of the people were very much abridged; and, on the
other hand, the influence and the authority of the bishops were
not a little augmented. At first the bishops did not deny that
they were merely the representatives of their churches, and
that they acted in the name of the people; but little by little
they made high pretensions, and maintained that power was
given them by Christ himself to dictate rules of faith and conduct
to the people. In the next place, the perfect equality and
parity of all bishops, which existed in the early times, these
councils gradually subverted. For it was necessary that one of
the confederated bishops of a province should in those conventions
be intrusted with some authority and power over the
others; and hence originated the prerogatives of metropolitans.
And lastly, when the custom of holding these councils had extended
over the Christian world and the universal Church had
acquired the form of a vast republic composed of many lesser
ones, certain head men were to be placed over it in different
parts of the world as central points in their respective countries.
Hence came the Patriarchs, and ultimately the Prince
of Patriarchs, the Roman Pontiff. (Ecclesiastical History, Vol.
I, pages 116, 117.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning this, I note the following facts:</p>
<p>1. That in the second century they digressed so far
from apostolic practice as to have one bishop over each
church, and that he had his elders under his control. He
was the pastor of that church.</p>
<p>2. That there was a confederation of churches into
councils.</p>
<p>3. These councils began to be held about the middle of
the second century, and resulted in augmenting the power of
the bishops and diminishing the privileges of the people.
This power on the part of the clergy was not assumed all at
once, but gradually assumed as the people would bear it.
These councils soon began to enact laws, and claimed authority
from Christ to thus dictate to the people.</p>
<p>4. That when the custom of holding these councils had
extended over the Christian world, and the Church had acquired
the form of a vast republic composed of many lesser
ones, certain head men were placed over it in different parts
of the world; hence came the patriarchs, and ultimately a
prince of patriarchs, the Roman pontiff.</p>
<p>For centuries the struggle between the Church of Rome
and the State raged furiously, so that when we reach the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
age of Hildebrand (A.D. 1073-1085) we find plots and
counterplots the order of the day. It was the height of his
ambition to subordinate the State to the Church, and subject
the Church to the absolute authority of the Pope. The
course pursued by Hildebrand and by aspiring pontiffs who
succeeded him resulted in an open conflict between the
papacy and the empire. In the persistent contest which
followed the papacy gained a decided advantage. That the
emperor was commissioned to preside over the temporal
affairs of men, while it was left for the pope to guide and
govern them in spiritual things, was a rule too vague for
defining the limits of spiritual and temporal jurisdiction.
The co-ordination, the equilibrium of the two powers was
a relation with which neither party would be content. It
was a struggle on both sides for universal monarchy. The
popes, by strategy and shrewd diplomacy, gained complete
supremacy over Western Europe, and for many years the
pope was everywhere acknowledged head of the Latin
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was during the progress of the struggle with the
empire,&rdquo; says Professor Fisher, &ldquo;that the papal power may
be said to have culminated. In the eighteen years (1198-1216)
in which Innocent III reigned the papal institution
shone forth in full splendor. The enforcement of celibacy
had placed the entire body of the clergy in closer relation to
the sovereign pontiff. The vicar of Peter had become the
vicar of God and of Christ. The idea of a theocracy on
earth, in which the pope should rule in this character, fully
possessed the mind of Innocent, who united to the courage,
pertinacity and lofty conceptions of Gregory VII a broader
range of statesmanlike capacity. In his view the two swords
of temporal and ecclesiastical power had both been given to
Peter and to his successors, so that the earthly sovereign
derived his prerogative from the head of the Church. The
king was to the pope as the moon to the sun; a lower luminary
shining with borrowed light. Acting on this theory,
he assumed the post of arbiter in the contention of nations,
and claimed the right to dethrone kings at his pleasure.&rdquo;
In the Church he assumed the character of universal bishop,
under the theory that all episcopal power was originally
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
deposited in Peter and his successors, and communicated
through this source to bishops, who were thus only the vicars
of the pope, and might be deposed at will. Being thus lifted
up, he said: &ldquo;Jesus Christ wills that the kingdom should be
priestly, and the priesthood kingly. Over all he has set me
as his vicar upon earth, so that as before Jesus &lsquo;every knee
shall bow,&rsquo; in like manner to his vicar all shall be obedient,
and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.&rdquo; Moreover,
he applied to himself the words of Jesus, &ldquo;All authority hath
been given unto me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; And again,
we hear one of them say: &ldquo;For every human creature it is
a condition of salvation to submit to the Roman pontiff.&rdquo;
Not only did they assert the necessity of obedience to the
pope, but they actually claimed the power to forgive sins
and to bestow eternal life. This is a striking fulfillment of
what Paul said to the Thessalonians: &ldquo;He opposeth and
exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped;
so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself
forth as God&rdquo; (II Thess. 2:4).</p>
<p>The corruption of the government of the Church naturally
led to the corruption of everything connected with
Christianity. A departure from the divine government in
one thing opens the way for other departures. Such a course
will soon cause men to lose sight of the Lord&rsquo;s directions and
cause them to follow the doctrines and commandments of
men. Prominent among the early departures from the
divine order was the substitution of infant baptism for that
of believers. This practice originated in the third century,
and grew out of the doctrine of original sin. It was contended
that baptism was regeneration in the sense of washing
away original sin; that infants were depraved by original
sin, and could not be saved without this washing away of
that sin, and therefore they baptized infants that they might
be saved. On this point Neander testifies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when now, on the one hand, the doctrine of corruption
and guilt, cleaving to human nature in consequence of the first
transgression, was reduced to a more precise and systematic
form, and, on the other from duly distinguishing between what
is outward and what inward in baptism (the baptism by water
and the baptism by the Spirit), the error became more firmly
established that without external baptism no one could be delivered
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
from that inherent guilt, or could be saved from the
everlasting punishment that threatened him, or raised to eternal
life; and when the notion of a magical influence, a charm connected
with the sacraments, continually gained ground, the
theory was finally evolved of the unconditional necessity of
infant baptism. About the middle of the third century this
theory was already generally admitted in the North African
Church. (Church History, Vol. I, pages 426, 427.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the same import is the testimony of Dr. Philip Schaff.
He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice of infant baptism in the church, with the customary
formula, &ldquo;for the remission of sins,&rdquo; and such accompanying
ceremonies as exorcism, presupposes the dominion of
sin and of demoniacal powers even in infancy. Since the child,
before the awakening of self-consciousness, has committed no
actual sin, the effect of baptism must relate to the forgiveness
of original sin and guilt. This was a very important point
from the beginning of the controversy, and one to which Augustine
frequently reverted.... Constrained by the idea of
original sin, and by the supposed necessity of baptism to salvation,
he does not shrink from consigning unbaptized children to
damnation itself.... The Catholic doctrine of the necessity
of outward baptism to regeneration and entrance into the
kingdom of God, forbade him a more liberal view respecting
the endless destiny of that half of the human race which die
in childhood. (History of the Christian Church, Vol. III, pages
835, 836.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The departure from the practice of immersion, the original
act performed in baptism, to affusion, was largely due
to the idea of the magical effect of water to cleanse the
polluted souls of men. It was believed to contain the whole
forgiving power of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. On this
account many put off baptism till death threatened them,
that their iniquities might be removed as the King of terrors
carried them into the land of spirits. The first case of the
kind on record is that of Novatian (A. D. 251), who was
&ldquo;baptized by affusion in the bed as he lay.&rdquo; At first this
practice caused a schism in the Church, but in the course of
time that which was the exception became the rule. On
this radical change from apostolic practice the learned Roman
Catholic bishop, Karl Joseph Hefele, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church has always been tender toward the sick; she
has hastened to confer baptism upon them, because it is necessary
to salvation; and for that reason she introduced clinical
baptism. (History of Church Councils, page 153.)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>There were no serious controversies about the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper until the early part of the ninth century, when one
Paschasius Radbert, a monk of &ldquo;great acuteness of mind,&rdquo;
wrote a book in which he promulgated the doctrine of transubstantiation.
In this book he took the position that the
wine in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is &ldquo;the very blood that ran out
of the Saviour&rsquo;s side upon the cross, and for that reason
water is mingled with the eucharistical wine;&rdquo; and the bread
&ldquo;is the very flesh of our Saviour which was born of the
Virgin.&rdquo; At first the doctrine was repugnant to the cultivated,
but it was broached in a rude age, and the monks
favored it; the materialistic character of European thought
assisted it, and gradually it had a host of friends and was
prepared to frown down all opposition. The controversy,
however, continued with fury till A. D. 1215, when Pope
Innocent III assembled a council in Rome, in the Lateran
Church, consisting of 412 bishops, in whose hearing he read
seventy canons which he had drawn up; among these was
the famous canon which gave transubstantiation a legal place
in the Catholic Church. The important part of the canon is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one universal church of the faithful, out of which
no one at all is saved; and in which Jesus Christ himself is at
once priest and sacrifice; whose body and blood, in the sacrament
of the altar, are truly constrained under the species of
bread and wine, which, through the divine power, are transubstantiated,
the bread into the body, and the wine into the blood;
that for the fulfillment of the mystery of unity, we may receive
of that which he received of ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another step was taken about 350 years later, when the
Council of Trent declared the host an atoning sacrifice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, since in the divine sacrifice which is performed in
the mass, the same Christ is contained and offered in an unbloody
manner, who, on the altar of the cross, offered himself,
with blood, once for all; the holy synod teaches that that sacrifice
is, and becomes of itself, truly propitiatory, so that if,
with a true heart and a right faith, with fear and reverence,
we approach to God, contrite and penitent, we may obtain
mercy and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord, forsooth,
being appeased by the offering of this, and granting
grace and the gift of repentance, remit crimes and sins, even
great ones; for it is one and the same host, the same person
now offering by the ministry of the priests, who when offered
himself upon the cross, only in a different manner of offering;
and by this unbloody sacrifice, the fruit of that bloody one are
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
abundantly received; only far be it that any dishonor should
be done to that by this. Wherefore according to the tradition
of the apostles, offering is duly made, not only for the sins,
pains, and satisfactions, and other necessities of the faithful
who are alive, but also for the dead in Christ, who are not yet
wholly cleansed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same council further declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any one shall deny that in the sacrament of the most
holy eucharist, there is contained really, truly, and substantially,
the body and the blood together with the soul and divinity,
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so whole Christ, but shall
say he is only in it in sign, or figure, or power, let him be accursed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not content with this it declares that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any one shall say that in the holy sacrament of the
eucharist, there remains the substance of the bread and wine,
together with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and shall deny that wonderful and remarkable conversion
of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and of the
whole substance of the wine into the blood, while only the appearance
of bread and wine remain, which conversion the Catholic
Church most appropriately names transubstantiation; let
him be accursed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Council of Tridentine says there is a whole Christ
in every particle of the Mass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any one shall deny that Christ entire is contained in the
venerable sacrament of the eucharist, under each species, and,
when they are divided, under every particle of each kind; let
him be accursed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The climax of blasphemy is reached when the Council of
Trent asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is, therefore, no reason to doubt but that all Christ&rsquo;s
faithful people, in their veneration, should render this most
holy sacrament the same worship which is due to the true God,
according to the custom which the Catholic Church has always
received.</p>

<h3 id="c25">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE CONFESSIONAL</span></h3>
<p>As the mass is the aggregate of the Romish doctrine, the
confessional is the chief of the papal system. By it the
decrees of the &ldquo;infallible Church&rdquo; are applied and carried
out with unequaled measure of minuteness and rigor.</p>
<p>That the New Testament requires the confession of sin
is not denied; but such a thing as secret confession in the
ear of a priest, to secure his absolution, was entirely unknown
in the early churches. Even in Rome it was not till about
the year 390 that there was a place appointed for the reception
of penitents, when they stood mourning during the
public service, from which they were excluded. They cast
themselves upon the ground with groans and lamentations;
the bishop who conducted the ceremony prostrated himself
and wept; flooded with fears the people groaned aloud; then
the bishop arose from his humble position and summoned up
the people, and, after praying for the people, he dismissed
them. This custom, with slight changes, was universal.
For some sins men were required to do penance during the
whole of their lives, and absolution was only granted them in
death; but the common course of penance consigned men
for ten, fifteen or twenty years to its various humiliating
stages. After the long, distressing penance was completed,
&ldquo;the candidate for restoration knelt down between the knees
of the bishop, or, in his absence, between those of the presbyter,
who, laying his hand upon his head, solemnly blessed
and absolved him. The people received him with transports
of joy, as one escaped from the coils of the old serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were then received into communion with the imposition
of hands, and the prayer of the whole church for
them. The form of their prayer was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, that takest
away the sin of the world, remit, blot out and pardon their
sins, both voluntary and involuntary, whatever they have done
by transgression and disobedience. And whereinsoever thy
servants have erred from thy commandments, in word or deed,
or whatever curse or peculiar anathema they have fallen
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
under, we pray and beseech thine ineffable goodness to absolve
them with thy word, and remit their curse and anathema, according
to thy mercy. O Lord and Master, hear our prayer
for thy servants and deliver them from eternal punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingham informs us that the form, &ldquo;I absolve you,&rdquo; was
not known in the practice till the beginning of the thirteenth
century. Thomas Aquinas was one of the first men to
write in defense of it. In his day the expression excited
much opposition. Pope Innocent III, ambitious to establish
a number of superstitions, called the fourth Council of the
Lateran, A. D. 1215, which declared that &ldquo;the church has
always understood that an entire confession of sins was
always appointed by the Lord, and that it is of divine requirement
necessary to all who have lapsed after baptism.
Because our Lord Jesus Christ, when about to ascend from
earth to heaven, left his priests, his vicars, to be, as it were,
the presidents and judges, to whom all mortal sins into which
Christ&rsquo;s faithful people should fall should be brought, in
order that, by the power of the keys, they might pronounce
sentence of remission or retention. For it is plain that the
priest can not exercise this judgment without knowledge of
the cause, nor can they observe equity in enjoining penalties
if men declare their sins only generally, and not particularly
and separately. From this it is inferred that it is right that
the penitent should recount in confession all the deadly sins
of which, upon examination, their conscience accuses them,
even though they be the most secret, and only against the last
two commandments, which not unfrequently grievously
wounds the soul and are more dangerous than those which
are openly practiced.&rdquo; This invests the priesthood with the
prerogative of God himself, who is the searcher and discerner
of &ldquo;the thoughts and intents of the heart.&rdquo; To this
demand all the members of the Catholic Church, whether
old or young, are required to bow, as is shown by the twenty-first
canon of the Lateran Council, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one of the faithful of both sexes, after he shall
have reached the years of discretion, shall, by himself alone,
faithfully confess all his sins, at least once a year, to his own
priest, and strive to perform according to his ability the penance
imposed upon him, reverently partaking of the sacrament
of the eucharist, at least at Easter; unless perhaps, by the
advice of his priest, for some reasonable cause, he should judge
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
that for a time he should abstain from partaking of it; otherwise,
let the living be hindered from entering the church, and
let the dead be deprived of Christian burial. On this account
this salutary statute shall be frequently published in the
churches that no one may pretend as an excuse the blindness of
ignorance. But if any one should wish to confess his sins to
a foreign priest, for proper reasons, he must first ask and obtain
a license from his own priest, since otherwise he would
not be able to bind or loose him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confessional as it exists today is chiefly the work of
the Council of Trent, and those who lived in the age immediately
after. In order to strike terror to the hearts of
all who might refuse to accede to the demands of the priesthood,
the Council of Trent published a number of canons
on penance, pronouncing the most awful curses on those
who refused obedience. I have not space to give the canons,
but they teach that the form of the sacrament of penance
in which its force especially lies is placed in the words, &ldquo;I
absolve thee,&rdquo; and that this absolution is not in words merely,
but that &ldquo;the ministers of God truly absolve.&rdquo; The priest is
declared to represent Christ in the confessional, and therefore
is invested with divine attributes and powers. The
language used is: &ldquo;Moreover, in the priest who sits a legitimate
judge over him, he should venerate the person and
power of Christ the Lord; for in administering the sacrament
of penance, as in the other sacraments, the priest discharges
the office of Christ.&rdquo; They further teach that the
confession of sins to a priest is necessary to salvation; and
that every mortal sin, even the most secret and infamous,
must be confessed to a priest, otherwise there can be no
pardon from God. Thus we see that they make the priest
the judge of the soul, and that in the confessional he sits
instead of Jesus Christ and that he can keep the sins of any
man bound upon him, or loose them, according to his discretion.</p>
<p>In the confessional the penitent kneels beside the priest,
makes the sign of the cross, saying: &ldquo;In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.&rdquo;
Then with her lips near the cheek of the priest she asks the
priest&rsquo;s blessing in these words: &ldquo;Pray, father, give me your
blessing. I have sinned,&rdquo; after which the penitent repeats:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>I confess to Almighty God, to blessed Mary, ever Virgin,
to blessed Michael, the archangel, to blessed John the Baptist,
to the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and to you, father, that I
have sinned exceedingly, in thought, word and deed, through
my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the questions of the confessional are too horrible
to quote. Were I to do so I would lay myself liable
to prosecution by the Government authorities. But every
question put by the priest must be answered by the penitent
on the peril of damnation; he sits instead of Christ, the
penitent is confessing to God, the voice of the priest is Immanuel&rsquo;s;
it is the Almighty that is addressing the trembling
penitent. And for this reason the priest hears everything,
however shocking, shameful, frightful; everything in
thoughts, feelings, words, looks and deeds. That the modesty
of women should be placed on the rack in the confessional
by a bachelor priest, full of curiosity as well as sanctity,
and torn and lacerated, under the awful sanctions of the
Almighty, is indeed a dreadful thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The confessional is the most odious espionage ever invented
by cunning despots. It is the most flagitious outrage
upon the rights of husbands and wives, parents and children,
the sinning and the sinned against, that ever shocked
modesty or ground trembling hearts under its fatal heel.
It is strongly believed to be the greatest incitement to vice
that a holy God ever permitted; frightful examples of which
are on record. It turns priests into odious receptacles for
the accumulated stench and nastiness of all the foul corruptions
of thousands, making them the sons of the Man of
Sin, ready bearers of the iniquities of whole communities.&rdquo;
Yes, it is a withering curse, a cruel tyranny, without one
redeeming quality, &ldquo;which the Lord Jesus shall slay with
the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation
of his coming.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c26">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="h3line2">INDULGENCES</span></h3>
<p>In order to make the absolution effective, the sacrament
of confession comprises penances by which the wrongs done
are paid. Originally the amount of satisfaction was measured
by the time alone during which the state of penance
should last. As we have already seen, this situation inflicted
the greatest disgrace, and caused the greatest distress
of mind. But gradually a change was wrought, and penitents
who showed undoubted sorrow were relieved of their
penance earlier than the old usage demanded. This abridgement
of the long sentence was called an indulgence, and was
really the beginning of that system which reached its infamous
maturity under Leo X and in the preaching of the
wicked Tetzel. In that age no one knew anything of purgatory
or the treasury of merits acquired by the saints, and
disposed by the Pope; or even of the supreme bishop at
Rome, with authority over all the churches and clergy everywhere.</p>
<p>At first indulgences were limited exclusively to church
penances, but in process of time they embraced all the temporary
punishments due the soul on earth and in purgatory.
Christ, it was said, had endured and removed the eternal
penalties of sin; but the sufferings short of everlasting continuance
must be borne in purgatory, pilgrimages, or be
removed by indulgence. The earthly sufferings could be
enduring by deputy&mdash;any amount of fasting, flagellation or
pilgrimage work could be discharged by substitute&mdash;and
throngs of monks in time of papal darkness were competitors
for the repulsive service.</p>
<p>It was argued that when a man performs his allotted
task for the day he deserves additional reward or credit
for any further services he may render. Such labors are
beyond what his agreement demands; they are works of
supererogation. So when a Christian leading a blameless
life is persecuted and killed, as his sins did not draw his sufferings,
these pains were meritorious, they were higher than
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
a man&rsquo;s deserts&mdash;these were works of supererogation. It
was claimed that millions of saints in heaven had left a
legacy of such merits to the Church, and that in it she had
a treasury of good deeds of immense value, incapable of
exhaustion, no matter how many drafts, through indulgences,
the Holy Mother might make upon it. Sometimes it was
said that one drop of the Saviour&rsquo;s blood was sufficient
for the sins of the whole world, and that all the rest went
into the treasury, which the Church might give to souls in
purgatory, or rich men on earth who had money to buy it,
or to men not so wealthy who had some means. This was
the paid-up capital of the bank of indulgences. The doctrine
and practice of indulgence constitute the very center
of the hierarchial system.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century the disposal of indulgences became
a common traffic, and public sale of them was generally
preceded by some specious pretext. Often the pretenses
for selling them were in reality bloody, idolatrous and superstitious.
Pope John XXIII empowered his legates to absolve
penitents from all sorts of crimes upon the payment
of sums of money proportioned to their guilt. D&rsquo;Aubigne,
in his &ldquo;History of the Reformation,&rdquo; tells us that when such
indulgences were to be published, the disposal of them was
commonly farmed out; for the papal court could not always
wait to have the money collected and conveyed from every
country of Europe. And there were rich merchants at
Genoa, Milan, Venice and Augsburg who purchased the
indulgences for a particular province, and paid to the papal
chancery handsome sums for them. Thus both parties were
benefited. The chancery came at once into large sums of
money, and the farmers did not fail of a good bargain.
They were careful to employ skillful men to sell the indulgences,
persons whose boldness and impudence bore due
proportion to the eloquence with which they imposed upon
the simple people. Yet, that this species of traffic might
have a religious aspect, the Pope appointed the archbishops
of the several provinces to be his commissaries, who in his
name announced that indulgences were to be sold, and generally
selected the men to sell them, and for this service shared
the profits with the merchants who farmed them. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
papal hawkers enjoyed great privileges, and, however odious
to the civil authorities, they were not molested. Complaints,
indeed, were made against these contributions, levied by the
popes upon all Europe. Kings and princes, clergy and
laity, bishops, monasteries and confessors, all felt themselves
aggrieved by them; the kings, that their countries were
impoverished, under the pretext of crusades that were never
undertaken, and of wars against heretics and Turks; and the
bishops, that their letters of indulgence were rendered inefficient,
and the people released from ecclesiastical discipline.
But at Rome all were deaf to all these complaints, and it
was not till the revolution produced by Luther that unhappy
Europe obtained the desired relief.</p>
<h4 id="c27">JOHN TETZEL</h4>
<p>Leo X, in order to carry on the expensive structure of
St. Peter&rsquo;s Church in Rome, published indulgences, with a
plenary remission to all such as should contribute toward
erecting that magnificent building. The right of promulgating
these indulgences in Germany, together with a share
in the profits arising from the sale of them, was granted to
John Tetzel, a Dominican friar, a licentious wretch, but an
active and enterprising spirit, and remarkable for his noisy
and popular eloquence. Assisted by the monks of his order,
selected as his chief agent for retailing them in Saxony,
he executed the commission with great zeal and success, but
with no less indecency.</p>
<p>That my readers may have some idea of the course pursued,
I give one of his harangues. After the cross had been
erected and the arms of the Pope suspended from it, Tetzel
went into the pulpit, and with a tone of assurance began to
extol the value of indulgences in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indulgences are the most precious and most noble of God&rsquo;s
gifts. This cross has as much efficacy as the very cross of
Jesus Christ. Come and I will give you letters, all properly
sealed, by which even the sins you intend to commit may be
pardoned. I would not change my privileges for those of
Saint Peter in heaven; for I have saved more souls by my
indulgences than the apostle by his sermons. There is no sin
so great that an indulgence can not remit; and even if one
(which it doubtless is impossible) had offered violence to the
Virgin Mary, Mother of God, let him pay&mdash;only let him pay
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
well, and all will be forgiven him. Reflect then, that every
mortal sin you must, after confession and contrition, do penance
for seven years, either in this life or in purgatory; now,
how many mortal sins are there not committed in a day, how
many in a week, how many in a month, how many in a year,
how many in a whole life! Alas, these sins are almost infinite,
and they entail an infinite penalty in the fires of purgatory.
And now, by means of these letters of indulgence, you
can once in your life, in every case except four, which are
reserved for the apostolic see, and afterward in the article of
death, obtain a plenary remission of all your penalties and all
your sins!</p>
<p>Do you know that if any one desires to visit Rome, or any
country where travelers incur danger, he sends his money to
the bank, and for every hundred florins that he wishes to have,
he gives five or six or ten more, that by means of the letters
of this bank he may be safely repaid his money at Rome or
elsewhere.... And you, for a quarter of a florin, will not
receive these letters of indulgence, by means of which you may
introduce into paradise not a vile metal, but a divine and immortal
soul, without its running any risk.</p>
<p>But more than this, indulgences avail not only for the
living, but for the dead. For that repentance is not even
necessary. Priests! nobles! merchant! wife! youth! maiden!
do you not hear your parents and your other friends who are
dead, and who cry from the bottom of the abyss: &ldquo;We are
suffering horrible torments! A trifling alms would deliver
us; you can give it, and you will not!&rdquo; At the very instant
that the money rattles in the bottom of the chest, the soul
escapes from purgatory, and flies liberated to heaven. Oh,
stupid and brutish people, who do not understand the grace
so richly offered! Now heaven is everywhere opened! Do
you refuse to enter now? When, then will you enter? Now
you can ransom so many souls! Stiff-necked and thoughtless
man! with twelve groats you can deliver your father from
purgatory, and you are ungrateful enough not to save him! I
shall be justified in the day of judgment; but&mdash;you will be
punished so much the more severely for having neglected so
great salvation. I declare to you, though you should have
but a single coat, you should strip it off and sell it, in order
to obtain this grace. The Lord our God no longer reigns. He
has resigned all power to the pope.</p>
<p>Do you know why our most Holy Lord distributes so rich
a grace? It is to restore the ruined Church of Saint Peter
and Saint Paul, and those of a multitude of martyrs. The
saintly bodies, through the present state of the building, are
now, alas, beaten upon, inundated, polluted, dishonored, reduced
to rottenness, by the rain and the hail. Alas, shall these
sacred ashes remain longer in the mire and in degradation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things, which
ye hear, and have not heard them!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Tetzel concluded his discourse he immediately
left the pulpit, ran to the money box, and, in the sight of
the people, dropped into it a coin, being very careful to make
it rattle so that it could be heard by the excited people. This
was the signal that &ldquo;indulgence had established its throne
in the place with due solemnity.&rdquo; Confessionals, decorated
with the pope&rsquo;s arms, were arranged in convenient places.
On &ldquo;each of these confessionals were posted in large letters
the names, the surnames and titles of the under commissaries
and of the confessors. Men, women and children crowded
around these confessionals, all with money in their hands.
Even those who lived on alms found money to buy indulgences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having privately explained to each individual the
greatness of indulgence, the confessors addressed the following
question to each penitent: &ldquo;How much money can
you conscientiously spare to obtain so complete a remission?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The demand,&rdquo; said the instructions of the archbishop of
Mentz to the commissaries, &ldquo;should be made at this moment,
in order that the penitents might be better disposed to contribute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all who should aid in building the cathedral of Saint
Peter in Rome, the following graces were promised: (1)
The full pardon for every sin; (2) the right of choosing a
confessor, who, whenever the hour of death appeared at
hand, should give absolution for all sin, even from the
greatest crimes reserved for the apostolic see; (3) a participation
in all the blessings, works and merits of the Catholic
Church, prayers, fasts, alms, and the pilgrimages; and
(4) redemption of the souls that are in purgatory. To
obtain the first of these graces it was said to be necessary
to &ldquo;have contrition of heart and confession of mouth, or at
least an intention of confessing. But as for the three
others they might be obtained without contrition, without
confession, simply by paying.&rdquo; The intention was to make
it appear that whoever possessed money could, by using it
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
in the purchase of indulgences, introduce souls into heaven.
The indulgence mongers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for those who would deliver souls from purgatory and
procure the pardon of all their offenses, let them put money
into the chest; contrition of heart or confession of mouth is
not necessary. Let them only hasten to bring their money:
for thus they will perform a work most useful to the souls of
the dead, and to the building of the Church of Saint Peter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confession over, there was a rush to the trafficker,
who examined very closely the dress, manner, gait and appearance
of the applicant. The sum required was measured
by his judgment of the financial ability of the individual.
If he made a mistake about the price set, he was empowered
to make the best bargain possible, &ldquo;and all was to be arranged
according to the data of sound reason, and the generosity of
the donor.&rdquo; For adultery, polygamy, sacrilege, perjury,
murder, witchcraft, infanticide, and fratricide he had a particular
tax. In fact, &ldquo;there was no vein in the gold mine
that they did not find the means of working.&rdquo; Tetzel executed
the commission with great zeal and success, but with
no less indecency. He assured the purchasers that their
crimes, however enormous, would be forgiven; that the
efficacy of indulgences was so great that the most heinous
sins would be expiated and remitted by them, and the person
freed both from punishment and guilt; and that this
was the unspeakable gift of God to reconcile men to himself.</p>
<p>In order that my readers may understand more fully the
frightful extent of the wickedness to which the traffic led,
I give the usual form of the letters of absolution, which was
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon thee, and
absolve thee by the merits of his most holy passion. And I,
by his authority, that of his apostles Peter and Paul, and of
the most holy pope, granted and committed to me in these
parts, do absolve thee, first, from all ecclesiastical censures, in
whatever manner they may have been incurred; then from all
thy sins, transgressions and excesses, how enormous soever
they may be; even such as are reserved for the cognizance of
our most holy father the pope and for the apostolic see. I
remit to thee all punishment which thou deservest in purgatory
on their account; and I restore thee to the holy sacraments of
the Church, to the unity of the faithful, and to the innocence
and purity which thou possessedst at baptism; so that when
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
thou diest the gates of punishment shall be shut, and the gates
of the paradise of delights shall be opened; and if thou shall
not die at present, this grace shall remain in full force when
thou art at the point of death. In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Friar John Tetzel,
commissary, has signed with his own hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This abolished all guilt and fear of hell in the minds of
the purchasers, and inasmuch as the sale of indulgences was
universally prevalent, the Church of Rome was everywhere
triumphant, darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness
the people; the children of God were driven to caves and
secret places of the earth, hunted by armed bands at the
command of the apostate Church. The condition was
appalling!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2>PART III
<br />The Reformation in Europe</h2>
<h3 id="c28">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="h3line2">JOHN WYCKLIFFE</span></h3>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church, as we have already seen,
had reached such a degree of corruption in doctrine and
practice, so deep and widespread, that it would seem quite
impossible for it to reach further degradation. The name
of Christ was everywhere professed, but a devout believer
was seldom found. The Christ was hidden that his pretended
representatives might be all in all. Justification by
faith was denounced in order to open up a trade in indulgences
to enrich the papacy by the sale of salvation. The
commands of God were openly made void by the doctrines
and commandments of men. Apostolic order and ordinances
had given place to those of the &ldquo;man of sin.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mystery
of lawlessness&rdquo; stood out in full proportions.</p>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, there were forces at
work, in different parts of Europe, moving on to conflict
and reform that were destined to break the all but universal
sway of the papacy. There can be no doubt that the invention
of printing, the gradual revival of learning, and the
enlarged acquaintance with the Scriptures, all made directly
against the then existing conditions. The Reformation was
effected and the names of its chief actors have come down
to us with deserved honor, and yet how imperfect the work
done and the spirit of the doers of it. Measuring both by
the doctrine and practice of the apostles can not but compel
the conclusion that the Reformation from the first onward
needed immense reformation to bring it up to the measures
of the divine standard. And still it may be that any nearer
approach to a completely scriptural work and spirit would
have been quite futile under the existing conditions.</p>
<p>John Wyckliffe, who flourished in the latter part of the
fourteenth century, popularly called the &ldquo;Morning Star of
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
the Reformation,&rdquo; was the first to distinguish himself in
fighting against the supremacy of the pope, the doctrine of
transubstantiation, and the abuses of the hierarchy. As
early as 1360 he became known as the opponent of the
mendicant friars who infested England, interfering with
school discipline, as well as domestic relations. He exposed
the venality and superstition of the monkish orders with a
vigor of reasoning and a keen satire. Efforts were made by
a commission appointed by the king to have the evil abrogated,
and such arrangements were finally made; but the
pope soon violated the compact and Parliament again took
action against the Roman usurpations. These developments
fully opened the eyes of Wyckliffe to the intolerant corruption
of the Roman See, and he began henceforth to argue
and teach, preach and write, boldly and without reserve
against the papal system.</p>
<h4 id="c29">TRANSLATES THE BIBLE INTO ENGLISH</h4>
<p>But the greatest work of Wyckliffe for the enlightenment
of the world was the translation of the Bible into the English
language. But in order to appreciate the difficulties of his
task, we should remember that Rome had not only utterly
neglected and contemned the Sacred writings, but had interdicted
their translation into any vernacular tongue. She
claimed that it was not only unlawful, but injurious, for the
people at large to read the Scriptures. Nor was this idea
left to pass current merely as a received opinion, but it was
a subject which was considered by councils, and canons were
enacted against it. Not to mention other proofs of this,
more than one hundred and fifty years before Wyckliffe
had finished his translation of the Bible, in the year 1229,
at the Council of Toulouse, forty-five canons were passed
and issued for the extinction of heresy and the re-establishment
of peace. One of these canons involved the first court
of inquisition, and another, the first canon, forbade the
Scriptures to the laity, or the translation of any portion of
them into the common tongue. The latter was expressed in
the following very pointed terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also forbid the laity to possess any of the books of the
Old or New Testament, except, perhaps, the Psalter or Breviary
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
for the Divine Offices, or the Hours of the Blessed Virgin, which
some, out of devotion, wish to have; but having any of these
books translated into the vulgar tongue, we strictly forbid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of all this, and far more than I can now explain,
Wyckliffe performed his arduous task of translation.
Of this great work, a competent critic most appropriately remarks:
&ldquo;From an early period of his life he had devoted
his various learning, and his powerful energies of mind, to
effect this, and, at length, by intense application on his part,
and from assistance from a few of the most learned of his
followers, he had the glory to complete a book, which, alone,
would have been sufficient (or at least ought) to have procured
the veneration of his own age, and the commendation
of posterity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While engaged in this work, in the year 1379, he was
taken violently ill, and the friars, imagining that his course
was now near its end, contrived to visit him. Four of their
ablest men had been selected, or a friar from each of the
mendicant orders, and they were admitted to a patient hearing.
After reminding him of the great injury he had done
to their order, they exhorted him, as one near to death, that
he would now, as a true penitent, bewail and revoke, in their
presence, whatever he had said to their disparagement. As
soon as they had done, Wyckliffe, calling for his servant,
desired to be raised up on his pillow; and then collecting all
his strength, with a severe and expressive countenance, and
in a tone not to be misunderstood, exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall not die, but live to declare the evil deeds of the
friars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confounded at such a reply, they immediately left him;
and he recovered, to finish in the next year his translation of
the entire Bible.</p>
<p>As this was before the invention of printing, the translation
could only be diffused by the laborious process of
transcription; but transcribed it was most diligently, both entire
and in parts, and as eagerly read. There were those
who, at all hazards, sought wisdom from the Book of God,
and their number could not be few. A contemporary writer,
an enemy, and in the language of hatred and fear combined,
with the wish to damage the cause, affirmed that &ldquo;a man
could not meet two people on the road, but one of them was
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
a disciple of Wyckliffe.&rdquo; Certainly the opportunity was
gladly received by the people; and while the word of the
Lord did not have &ldquo;free course,&rdquo; there can be no question
that it was &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; in the reception given it by many.
The same bitter opponent, in the tone of deep lamentation,
makes the following remarkable admission about the wonderful
progress made in the face of bitter persecution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The soldiers, with the dukes and earls, are the chief adherents
of this sect, its most powerful defenders, and its invincible
protectors. This Master John Wyckliffe hath translated
the Gospel out of Latin into English, which Christ had
entrusted with the clergy and doctors of the Church, that they
might minister it to the laity and weaker sort, according to
the state of the times and the wants of men. So that by this
means the Gospel is made vulgar, and laid more open to the
laity, and even to women who can read, than it used to be to
the most learned of the clergy and those of the best understanding!
And what was before the chief gift of the clergy and
doctors of the Church, is made forever common to the laity!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At about the same time another papal dupe, in the same
spirit, most vehemently urged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prelates ought not to suffer that every one at his
pleasure should read the Scriptures, translated even into Latin;
because, as is plain from experience, this has been many ways
the occasion of falling into heresies and errors. It is not,
therefore, politic that any one, wheresoever and whensoever he
will, should give himself to the frequent study of the Scriptures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These men just quoted referred to the period between
1380 and 1400, and it was one, though but too short, which
distinguished England from every other country in Europe.
However transient, it was one that had much to do with
wresting the world from the appalling darkness and ruin
wrought by the papacy, and flooding the world with the
glorious sunlight of eternal truth. It was all in vain that
the bishops, with the primates of Canterbury at their head
bellowed and remonstrated with the people, wrote letters to
and received letters from Rome, made and executed fearful
threats of punishment; the Bible had been translated, the
people transcribed and read, and sent copies of it far and
near.</p>
<p>In 1400 Parliament enacted a law that gave bishops the
power to hand over obstinate or relapsed heretics to sheriffs
and magistrates, who were enjoined to have them publicly
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
burnt. In 1401 William Sawtre, a devout man, was burnt
at Smithfield as a heretic. Of the many victims, I have
only space to mention J. Badby, who was burnt in a barrel;
and especially that generous friend of the Reformation, Sir
John Oldcastle, who frequently sheltered preachers of reform
in his castle, and devoutly did he adhere to these doctrines,
since, as he himself attested his whole life through
them had undergone a change. Henry V had made vain
efforts to induce him to change from his faith; but he refused
to recant, and was condemned as a &ldquo;pernicious heretic&rdquo;
in 1413. But during the respite granted him, he managed
to escape into Wales, where he concealed himself till 1417,
when he was captured and executed at St. Giles&rsquo; Fields,
amidst the most barbarous tortures, being roasted over a
slow fire. The escape of Oldcastle and the rumors of a
Lollard insurrection the following year were made the occasion
for fresh measures of persecution. In 1414 it was
ordered that all public officials should bind themselves by
oath to aid in the extirpation of heresy, and that the lands
and possessions of those convicted of heresy should be confiscated.</p>
<p>In 1416 a regular inquisition was instituted in every
parish of the diocese of Canterbury. Among the common
people, however, the desire for Biblical knowledge continued
to spread; secret conventicles were held; and though the
persecution, which lasted till 1431, may have crushed the
&ldquo;heresy,&rdquo; the principles lived and spread worldwide, and
became the influence that led to reformation in other parts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h3 id="c30">CHAPTER II.<br /><span class="sc">William Tyndale</span></h3>
<p>If I were to follow the strictly chronological order, I
would here give a sketch of Luther and his work, but as I
have given an account of the work of Wyckliffe, it is proper
to give attention to the work of William Tyndale, because
I am now seeking the basic principle of the return to apostolic
purity and simplicity.</p>
<p>At the opening of the sixteenth century, a period of great
interest to all the world, were four men&mdash;Le Fevre, in
France; Zwingli, in Switzerland; Luther, in Germany, and
Tyndale, in England&mdash;destined to make a great impression
on the world for all time. But they were wholly unknown
to each other. In France, Switzerland and Germany were
the living voices throughout life, of the men raised up, calling
upon their countrymen to hear and obey the truth; and
so it was in England a century and a half before, in the case
of Wyclif. But in the case of Tyndale, the procedure is
entirely different, and out of the usual course pursued in
other lands. He had, it is true, lifted up his voice with
some effect, but he was driven from his native land, never
to return. In the other cases the men lived and died at
home. Le Fevre when above one hundred years old wept
because he had not felt and displayed the courage of a
martyr; Zwingli, in battle for his country; and Luther, after
his noble intrepidity, expired in his sick chamber; but Tyndale
was strangled and his body burnt to ashes in a foreign
land. Englishmen, Scotchmen and Germans were gathered
together against him; yes, men of three nations at least
concur to confer upon him the martyr&rsquo;s crown, so that
among all his contemporaries, in several respects, but especially
as a translator of the Scriptures, he stands alone.</p>
<p>The political and literary condition of England under
Cardinal Wolsey did not afford the slightest indication that
the Scriptures were about to be given to the people in their
native tongue, but the reverse. In justice to that event it is
necessary to observe, also, the nature of that connection
which had existed for ages between Britain and Rome. Indeed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
under Henry VIII it reached its climax. This connection
sustained a peculiarly complicated character. There
were no fewer than twelve distinct sources of revenue that
went directly to Rome. These altogether were operating
on the inhabitants without exception, and with as much regularity
as the rising and setting of the sun. &ldquo;It was a pecuniary
connection of immense power, made to bear upon the
general conscience, which knew no pause by day or night;
falling, as it did, not merely on the living, but on the dying
and the dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In no other country throughout Europe was the papal
system in all its oppressive and fearful integrity more fully
maintained. Under the unscrupulous and imperative Henry
VIII, who gloried in his knowledge of divinity and prided
himself on his orthodoxy, with a prime minister so well
known in every foreign court, and who himself yearned for
the pontificate, England had become the mainstay of the system.
In Worcester diocese above every other part of England
was this power of Rome most intensely felt, yet here in
about 1484 was William Tyndale born whose labors were
destined to work the overthrow of its power in the realm.</p>
<h4 id="c31">ERASMUS ARRIVES IN ENGLAND</h4>
<p>Erasmus arrived in England in 1498, and was delighted
to find a taste for the study of Hebrew, Greek and Latin so
pronounced, and he pursued his studies with great diligence
and satisfaction. His zeal so inspired others that the influence
of his residence there may be regarded as the opening
of a new era in letters in that country. In 1516 the
first edition of his Greek New Testament was published,
accompanied by a new Latin translation, and spread far
and wide. He received the hearty congratulations of his
friends, but its appearance raised up a host of enemies.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the opposition during the period during
1477 to 1526, fourteen editions of the Bible in Hebrew and
Greek were published, and not one of the sacred originals
had ever been restrained by any government. In fact, at
this time, so far from such restraint being imposed in England,
it was encouraged; as not a man in high authority
seems to have foreseen that the cultivation of the knowledge
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
of the original language would necessarily lead to a translation
of the sacred volume into the common tongue. Even
Henry VII transmitted to the university a royal mandate
&ldquo;that study of the Scriptures in the original language should
not only be permitted, but received as a branch of the
academical institution.&rdquo; And this was at the period when
Tyndale resided at Cambridge and Oxford. The advantages
thus combined fully explain the source of the superior attainments
in learning which he afterward turned to such wonderful
account.</p>
<p>About 1504 Tyndale went to Oxford University, and
took his degree of B.A., in 1508. One of the colleges at
Oxford had forbidden the entrance of the Greek New Testament
within its walls &ldquo;by horse or by boat, by wheels or on
foot.&rdquo; Possibly owing to this enmity Tyndale left Oxford
for Cambridge, where Erasmus was teaching Greek and
issuing his edition of the Greek New Testament. About
the close of 1521 we find Tyndale as tutor in the family of
Sir John Walsh, at Little Sudbury, in Gloucestershire, twelve
miles north of Bristol. Walsh always kept a good table,
and abbots, deans, archdeacons, and divers other doctors who
were fond of discussion, were often invited to share his
hospitality. In these discussions Tyndale always bore a conspicuous
and decided part. He had an uncomfortable way
of crushing his opponents by clinching his arguments with a
&ldquo;thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; His outspoken way caused Lady
Walsh many an uneasy hour, and she often reminded him
that bishops, abbots and others having an income of hundreds
of pounds yearly held views the very opposite of his, &ldquo;and
were it reason that we should believe you before them?&rdquo;
Not being so skilled in the use of Scripture knowledge as
some in these days of Gospel light and liberty, this was very
embarrassing to him, a moneyless man, coming from such a
source. In order to strengthen his position with his wavering
hostess by the testimony of Erasmus, whose fame was
resounding throughout Europe, he translated his &ldquo;Christian
Soldier&rdquo; into English and presented it to Walsh and his
wife. This won her, and they did not invite the clergy to
their table any more. This change was attributed to Tyndale,
and ever afterward they treasured a grudge against
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
him. Of this opposition Fox says: &ldquo;These blind and rude
priests, flocking together to the alehouse, for that was their
preaching place, raged and railed against him; affirming that
his sayings were heresy, adding of their own heads moreover
unto his sayings more than ever he spake.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c32">TYNDALE RESOLVES TO TRANSLATE THE BIBLE INTO ENGLISH</h4>
<p>Fortunately Tyndale has left on record his reflections at
this period of his life. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thousand books had they lever [rather] to be put forth
against their abominable doings and doctrines, than that the
Scripture should come to light. For as long as they may keep
that down, they will so darken the right way with the mist of
their sophistry, and so tangle them that either rebuke or despite
their abominations with arguments of philosophy, and with
worldly and apparent reasons of natural wisdom, and with
wresting the Scriptures to their own purpose, clean contrary
unto the process, order, and meaning of the text; and so delude
them in descanting upon it with allegories, and amaze them,
expounding it in many senses, whose light the owls can not
hide, that though thou feel in thy heart, and art sure, how
that all is false that they saw, yet couldst thou not solve their
subtle riddles. Which thing only moved me to translate the
New Testament. Because I have proved by experience, how
that it is impossible to establish the lay people in any truth,
except the Scripture were plainly laid before their eyes in their
mother tongue, that they might see the process, order and meaning
of the text; for else, whatever truth is taught them, these
enemies of all truth quench it again&mdash;partly with the smoke of
their bottomless pit (Rev. 9), that is with apparent reasons of
sophistry, and traditions of their own making; and partly in
juggling with the text, expounding it in such a sense as it is
impossible to gather of the text itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Convocation of Canterbury had expressly forbidden
any man to translate any part of the Scripture in English,
or to read any such translation without authority of the
bishop, an authority not likely to be granted. The study
of the Bible was not even a part of the preparatory study
of the religious teachers of the people. Writing against
Alexander Alesius to James V of Scotland, Cochl&aelig;us, the
notorious Roman Catholic theologian, writes about the Bible
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Testament translated into the vulgar tongue, is
in truth the food of death, the fuel of sin, the veil of malice,
the pretext of false liberty, the protection of disobedience, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
corruption of discipline, the depravity of morals, the termination
of concord, the death of honesty, the well-spring of vice,
the disease of virtues, the instigation of rebellion, the milk of
pride, the nourishment of contempt, the death of peace, the
destruction of charity, the enemy of unity, the murderer of
truth. (Demaus&rsquo; Biography of William Tyndale, page 358.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such a sentiment prominent among the clergy, there
is no surprise at the danger to which Tyndale subjected himself
when in a warm discussion he revealed his intention.
Of this incident Fox says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communing and disputing with a certain learned man in
whose company he happened to be, he drove him to that issue,
that the learned man said, &ldquo;We were better to be without God&rsquo;s
law than the pope&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Master Tyndale hearing that, answered
him, &ldquo;I defy the pope and all his laws; and if God spare my
life many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plow to
know more of the Scripture than you do!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, the murmurings of the priests increased to a
fury. Such language flew over the country as on the wings
of the wind. They branded him as a heretic, and hinted
loudly of burning him.</p>
<p>It was now evident to Tyndale that a crisis had been
reached, and he saw too clearly that it would be impossible
for him to remain longer at Little Sudbury in the home of
Walsh in peaceful prosecution of his great purpose. This
purpose he was determined to prosecute whatever inconvenience
or danger it might bring upon him; and it seemed
to him quite possible that he might find that liberty in some
other part of England. He resolved, therefore, to give up
his position which he held in the family of Walsh. So with
the good will of Walsh, he made his way to London, hoping
to find in Cuthburt Tunstal, Bishop of London, a liberal
patron under whose protection the work might be prosecuted.
Tunstal accorded him an interview, acknowledged his scholarship,
but said that his house was already full, and advised
him to seek a place elsewhere. While in London Tyndale
preached at St. Dunstan&rsquo;s-in-the-West, and greatly impressed
Humphrey Monmouth, a wealthy, educated, traveled cloth
merchant, who took him into his house, where he remained
six months diligently engaged in translating the New Testament.
For this kindness Monmouth was imprisoned in the
Tower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>While in London, Tyndale saw men around him led to
prison and to death for having or reading the writings of
Luther, which were finding their way into England, and he
knew well that a Bible translation would be still a more dangerous
book. At last he &ldquo;understood not only that there
was no room in my lord of London&rsquo;s palace to translate the
New Testament, but, also, that there was no place to do it
in all England.&rdquo; But Tyndale was not the man to put his
hands to the plow and then turn back. If only a life in exile
could do the work, a life of exile he would gladly accept. As
Fox remarks: &ldquo;To give the people bare text of Scriptures,
he would offer his body to suffer what pain of torture, yea,
what death His Grace (Henry VIII) would so that this be
obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c33">GOES TO HAMBURG</h4>
<p>Having now fully decided on going abroad, he sailed
direct to Hamburg, about May, 1524, never to set foot on
his native soil again. Scarcely a year before, he entered
London with bright anticipations of success, but all his anticipations
had been cruelly disappointed, and now in sorrow
and sadness he was sailing forth on the untried dangers of
solitude and exile. Had he been able to read the future
that awaited him, and which he afterwards so patiently bewailed,
&ldquo;the poverty, the exile from his own native land,
the bitter absence from his friends, the hunger, the thirst,
the cold, the great danger wherewith he was everywhere
compassed, the innumerable hard and sharp fightings which
he had to endure,&rdquo; doubtless his loving soul would have
been melted with the spectacle, and yet, no doubt, the stout
and brave heart would have gone forward, &ldquo;hoping with his
labors to do honor to God, true service to his prince,&rdquo; and
bestow unspeakable blessings upon his priest-ridden people.</p>
<p>In Hamburg he diligently applied his whole time to translating,
but on being interrupted he moved to Cologne about
the first of May, 1525, where he put his translation into the
hands of the printer. Not only was the entire sacred text
then translated, but his prologue was composed before he
began to print. At this time John Cochl&aelig;us, dean of Frankfort,
the &ldquo;watchdog of Romanism,&rdquo; was at Cologne, an exile
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
from his own city on account of uprisings of the peasants
against the clergy. He was occupied at Cologne printing a
book. In consequence of this he became acquainted with the
printers of Cologne, whom he heard confidently boasting
over their cups that whether the king and cardinal
would or not all England in a short time would be furnished
the New Testament in English. He heard that there was
&ldquo;an Englishman there, learned, skilled in languages, eloquent,
whom, however, he never could see or converse with.&rdquo; Inviting,
therefore, some printers to his lodging, and, after
exciting them with wine, one of them disclosed to him that
the New Testament had been translated into the English
language; that it was then in the hands of the printers, who
were then printing an edition of three thousand copies; and
that the expenses were being met by English merchants, who
were to convey it secretly to England and dispense it widely
throughout the realm before the king or the cardinal could
discover or prohibit it.</p>
<p>Though mentally distracted between fear and wonder,
Cochl&aelig;us disguised his grief in a cheerful manner; and after
having considered sadly the magnitude of the danger, he deliberated
with himself how he might conveniently obstruct
&ldquo;these very wicked attempts.&rdquo; So he went to Herman
Rinck, a Senator of Cologne, and a knight, well known both
to the Emperor and the King of England, to whom he made
known the whole affair. On hearing this Rinck went to the
Senate of Cologne, and procured an order interdicting the
printers from proceeding further with the work. Tyndale
contrived, however, to procure the printed sheets, and sailed
up the Rhine to Worms about October, 1525; but Rinck and
Cochl&aelig;us wrote at once to the king and cardinal and the
Bishop of Rochester to take the utmost precaution in all the
seaports of England, lest that &ldquo;most pernicious article of
merchandise should be introduced.&rdquo; Apparently nothing
could have been more complete than the triumph of Cochl&aelig;us.
He had not only interrupted the printing of the New
Testament at Cologne, but had disclosed the secret of Tyndale&rsquo;s
intentions to those who were most able to take effectual
steps to prevent the introduction of the work in England,
if he should ever succeed in getting it printed at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>This interruption, though felt most keenly at the time by
Tyndale, only inflamed his zeal, and the remarkable result
was that two editions were issued by him in the same period
in which he had contemplated only one. Thus the hostility
of Cochl&aelig;us, which, as we have seen, threatened to arrest
the progress of the work, only delayed its completion for a
time and enabled Tyndale to issue six thousand copies of
his translation instead of three thousand. &ldquo;Early in 1526
both editions were sent into England in cases, in barrels, in
bales of cloth, in sacks of flour, and in every other secret
way that could be thought of.&rdquo; The reception in England
was remarkable. They were eagerly bought and read to the
inexpressible joy and comfort of thousands who had long
walked in darkness, and as eagerly proscribed and sought
out for destruction. Sir Thomas More fiercely attacked the
translation as ignorant, dishonest and heretical. In the
autumn Tunstal and Warham issued mandates for the collection
and surrender of copies. Tunstal attacked it in a
sermon at St. Paul&rsquo;s, and professed to have found three
thousand errors in it. So the cardinal and all the bishops
decided that the book should be burned, which was vigorously
carried out. But this was all in vain, for the tide was
fairly flowing and it could not be checked. A formidable
organization was ready in England to welcome and circulate
the books. In proportion to the violence with which the
clergy condemned the books was the esteem in which they
were held by those in England to whom the light was breaking.</p>
<h4 id="c34">BISHOP OF LONDON SUPPLIES MONEY TO PRINT BIBLES</h4>
<p>In 1529 Bishop Tunstal went to Antwerp to seize Tyndale&rsquo;s
Testaments, and by a singular coincident Tyndale also
was there and so it happened that one Parkington, who favored
Tyndale, was at Antwerp at the same time. On being
informed by the bishop that he would be glad to buy the
Testaments, Parkington told him that, as he knew those
who had them for sale, he could buy &ldquo;every book of them
that is imprinted and is here unsold.&rdquo; The bargain was
made, and as has been said by the quaint chronicler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bishop, thinking he had God by the toe, when indeed
he had, as after he thought, the devil by the fist, said: &ldquo;Gentle
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
Mr. Parkington, do your diligence and get them; and with
all my heart I will pay for them whatsoever they cost you, for
the books are erroneous and nought, and I intend surely to
destroy them all, and to burn them at Paul&rsquo;s Cross.&rdquo; Augustus
Parkington came to William Tyndale, and said: &ldquo;William, I
know that thou art a poor man, and hast a heap of New Testaments
and books by thee, for which thou hast both endangered
thy friends and beggared thyself; and I have now gotten thee a
merchant, which, with ready money, shall dispatch thee of all
thou hast, if thou think it so profitable for yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who
is this merchant?&rdquo; said Tyndale. &ldquo;The Bishop of London,&rdquo;
said Parkington. &ldquo;Oh, that is because he will burn them,&rdquo;
said Tyndale. &ldquo;Yea, marry,&rdquo; quoth Parkington. &ldquo;I am the
gladder,&rdquo; said Tyndale, &ldquo;for these two benefits shall come thereof:
I shall get money to bring myself out of debt, and the whole
world will cry out against the burning of God&rsquo;s Word; and the
overplus of the money that shall remain to me shall make me
more studious to correct the New Testament, and so newly to
imprint the same once again, and I trust the second will much
better like you than ever did the first.&rdquo; And so went forward
the bargain; the bishop had the books; Parkington had the
thanks, and Tyndale had the money.</p>
<p>After this, Tyndale corrected the same New Testament,
and caused them to be newly imprinted, so that they came thick
and threefold over into England. When the bishop perceived
that, he sent for Parkington, and said to him: &ldquo;How cometh
this, that there are so many New Testaments abroad? You
promised me that you would buy them all.&rdquo; Then said Parkington:
&ldquo;Surely, I bought all that were to be had, but I perceive
they have printed more since. I see it will never be
better so long as they have letters and stamps; wherefore you
were best to buy the stamps, too, and so you shall be sure.&rdquo;
At which the bishop smiled and so the matter ended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It so happened that shortly after this that George Constantine
was apprehended by Sir Thomas More, suspected
of certain heresies. During the time he was in custody,
More said to him: &ldquo;There are beyond the sea Tyndale,
Joyce, and a great many of you, I know they can not live
without help, and I pray thee tell me who they are that help
them thus?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; quoth Constantine, &ldquo;I will tell
you truly, it is the Bishop of London that hath helped us,
for he hath bestowed among us a great deal of money upon
New Testaments to burn them; and that hath been, and yet
is, our only succor and comfort.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now my troth,&rdquo; quoth
More, &ldquo;I think even the same, for so much I told the bishop
before he went about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h4 id="c35">BETRAYED AND MURDERED</h4>
<p>Tyndale&rsquo;s enemies endeavored to decoy him into England,
but he was too wary to be so easily entrapped, for he well
knew what displeasure Henry VIII felt at his tract, called
&ldquo;The Practice of Prelates,&rdquo; and what penalty the royal indignation
would speedily inflict. But his enemies in England,
whose power had been shaken by the wide circulation
of the English New Testament, were the more enraged
against him, and conspired to seize him on the Continent, in
the name of the Emperor, and through the treachery of one
Henry Philips, a smooth, treacherous villain, in the employ
of Stephen Gardiner, after having invited Tyndale to dine
with him, had him arrested and had him put in the State
prison of the Castle of Vivorde, twenty-three miles from
Antwerp, May 23, 1535. The English merchants aggrieved
by the loss of an esteemed friend, and by this treacherous
assault of their rights and privileges, made every effort to
secure his release, but all in vain. The neighboring University
of Louvain thirsted for his blood. He was speedily
condemned, and on Friday, October 6, 1536, he was strangled
at the stake and his body then burned to ashes. At the stake,
with a fervent zeal and a loud voice, he cried: &ldquo;Lord, open
the King of England&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an apostle of liberty, Tyndale stands foremost among
the writers of his day, whose heroic fortitude and invincible
love of the truth were heard with a force superior to royal
and ecclesiastical injunctions; and &ldquo;the very flames to which
fanaticism and tyranny consigned his writings burnt them
into the very hearts of the people, and made them powerful
instruments in attacking and converting multitudes to the
principles of the Reformation. It is not exaggeration to
say that the noble sentiments of William Tyndale, uttered
in pure, strong, Saxon English, and steeped in the doctrines
of the Gospel, gave shape to the views of the most conspicuous
promoters of the great movement, who, like himself,
sealed their convictions with their blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h3 id="c36">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="h3line2">MARTIN LUTHER</span></h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the papacy had universal
sway over Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century,
it must be noted that, from the beginning of the fourteenth
century on, there were insurgents, however varied their
cries and watchwords, who were persistent in their denunciation
of the priesthood. The hatred arose from their intolerable
extortions, which were a galling burden. While
the tithing system was an intolerable yoke, the rapacity of
the priests went far beyond tithes in their exactions. In
speaking of this condition, Seebohm, a Spanish historian,
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see that we can scarcely get anything from Christ&rsquo;s ministers
but for money; at baptism money, at marriage money, at
bishoping money, for confession money&mdash;no, not extreme unction
without money! They ring no bells without money, no burials
in the Church without money; so that it seems that Paradise is
shut up from them that have no money. The rich is buried in
the church, the poor in the churchyard. The rich man may
marry his nearest kin, but the poor not so, albeit he is ready
to die for love of her. The rich may eat meat in Lent, but the
poor may not, albeit fish be much dearer. The rich may readily
get large indulgences, but the poor none, because he wanteth
money to pay for them. (&ldquo;The Era of the Protestant Revolution,&rdquo;
pages 57, 58.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the efforts at reformation had always ignominiously
failed, and the papacy with all its abuses had never been
more powerful than at the time John Tetzel was trafficking
in indulgences. Just thirty-four years before this time,
Martin Luther was born. His parents were poor, but it
was their desire to give him the best education possible.
When he was fourteen years old they sent him to school at
Magdeburg, where he relied upon the liberality of well-meaning
citizens to supply his needs. The tuition was free
at Magdeburg, but the students were required to provide
their own lodgings and meals. The usual custom was for
a company of poor boys to band themselves together and
sing in the front of the house of the wealthy citizens. Sometimes
they would be invited to a meal; at other times they
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
would receive the remnants of a repast or at least some slices
of bread.</p>
<p>After a year had gone by his father decided to send him
to Eisenach, because he hoped that some of his relatives
would take a kindly interest in him; but in this expectation
he was mistaken, for as before he was compelled to beg and
sing for his bread. Many times young Luther became so
discouraged that he made up his mind to return to his home
and become a miner like his father. But a very different
life was awaiting him. When he had acquired the discipline
resulting from the long struggle with poverty, a great change
took place.</p>
<h4 id="c37">A FRIEND INDEED</h4>
<p>One day, after having been harshly treated at three
houses, he was preparing to return fasting to his lodgings;
he stopped motionless in front of a house and reflected,
&ldquo;Must I for the want of food give up my studies and return
with my father in the mines?&rdquo; when suddenly a door opens
and Madame Ursula Cotta, the wife of a wealthy merchant,
stood on the threshold. She had heard the harsh words that
had been addressed to him, and, seeing him standing thus
sadly before her door, she came to his aid, beckoned to him to
enter, and gave him food to satisfy his hunger. She and
her husband took a liking to him, and offered him a place at
their table and in their family, where he remained for three
years. Thus were brought into his life the influences of
gentleness and refinement.</p>
<p>A new life now opened to him. Free from care and
anxiety as to his sustenance, he was able to devote his whole
time to his studies. Here noble influences, very necessary
for his future work, surrounded him, teaching him the fine
and gentle traits of good breeding that elevated life above
the struggle for mere existence and gave to it its peculiar
charm. &ldquo;The strength of his understanding, the liveliness
of his imagination, the excellence of his memory, soon carried
him beyond all his school fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These years of his school period contributed much towards
promoting that higher education which his father was
so very anxious that he should obtain. Thus furnished,
in the summer of 1501, in his eighteenth year, he entered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
University of Erfurt. Here he applied himself diligently
and made rapid progress. He did not merely study to cultivate
his intellect. He had serious thoughts about God, and
fervently invoked the divine blessings to rest upon his labors.
He passed all the time that he could possibly spare from his
studies in the university library. Books were very scarce,
and it was a great privilege for him to have access to the
&ldquo;great collection of books there brought together.&rdquo; After
having been in the university for two years, one day, to his
great surprise and delight, he found a copy of the Bible, the
first that he had ever seen. His interest was greatly excited.
&ldquo;He was filled with astonishment at finding other
matters than those fragments of the Gospels and Epistles
that the Church had selected to be read to the people during
public worship throughout the year. Until this day he had
imagined that they composed the whole Word of God.&rdquo;
And now he sees so much of which he had never thought!
With eagerness and great emotion he turned its pages. The
first passage on which he fixed his attention was the story
of Hannah and Samuel, which gave him unbounded joy.
He returned to his room with a full heart, saying, &ldquo;Oh, that
God would give me such a book for myself!&rdquo; The copy of
the Bible that had filled him with so much joy was in Latin.
After this he returned to the library again and again to
pore over this wonderful treasure, and thus the glimmerings
of new truth were beginning to dawn upon his mind. &ldquo;In
that Bible the Reformation lay hid.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c38">BECOMES A MONK</h4>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s father required him to study law. At considerable
expense the necessary books had been purchased, and
he had begun to attend lectures on jurisprudence; but for the
calling he had no love; and yet, from a sense of obedience
to his father, he felt it his duty to follow the path he had
prescribed. He was, however, frequently disturbed by the
thought of the endangered spiritual condition of those who
followed the legal profession. This conflict quickened within
him the sense of his relation to the higher law, on which
his obedience to his father was based. The sudden death
of a friend followed shortly afterward by a narrow escape
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
from death by lightning, in a forest on the way between
Erfurt and Eisleben, determined him to obey what he then
regarded as the commands of higher law. Terrified by the
violence of the storm that was raging around him, and especially
by the bolts of lightning that were crashing through
the trees, addressing one of the patron saints of his childhood,
he cried out: &ldquo;Help me, dear Saint Anna, I will be
a monk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vow thus made was faithfully performed. Two
weeks later, July 16, 1505, he invited his most intimate
friends to a cheerful but frugal supper. For the last time
he determined to enjoy music and song. The decision once
made all sadness was gone. His intention was to tell no
one of his decision, but at the very moment his guests were
giving way to their gayety, he could no longer control the
serious thoughts that filled his mind. They endeavored to
dissuade him from his purpose, but all in vain. Sorrowfully
they accompanied him the next morning to the Augustinian
cloister located in the town, where he knocked for admission.
As they opened, he entered. When the heavy portals
of the monastery closed behind him, and the bars were
fastened again, he had no idea but that he was separated
from the world forever. The great struggle was at an end.
Was his soul satisfied? Had he found that for which he
was looking&mdash;the &ldquo;peace that passeth all understanding&rdquo;?
We shall see in our next.</p>
<p>Luther was received among the novices of the monastery
with sacred hymns, prayers and other solemnities. After
this he was given over to the care of the master of the
novices, whose duty it was to initiate them into the practices
of the monastic sanctity, to observe their actual conduct,
and to watch over their souls. Above all things, the will
of the novices were to be entirely broken. They were to
learn that everything enjoined upon them was to be performed
without the least resistance, and even to be the more
willing to render obedience the more it was against their
own disposition and taste. Inclination to pride was to be
overcome by imposing upon them the meanest services. So
at the very beginning of Luther&rsquo;s monastic life he was compelled
to perform the most degrading work in sweeping and
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
scrubbing, and it afforded those envious of him peculiar
pleasure when he, the hitherto proud young master, was ordered,
with a sack upon his shoulders, to beg through the
town in company with a more experienced brother. He
did not shirk from these services; but even desired to perform
self-mortifying duties, so that he might the more deserve
God&rsquo;s favors. Of these days Luther says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose for myself twenty-one saints, read mass every day,
calling on three of them each day, so as to complete the circuit
every week; especially did I invoke the Holy Virgin, as her
womanly heart was more easily touched, that she might appease
her Son. I verily thought that by invoking three saints daily,
and by letting my body waste away with fastings and watchings,
I should satisfy the law, and shield my conscience against
the goad; but it all availed me nothing: the further I went on
in this way the more I was terrified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we see that Luther subjected himself to every
possible form of discipline and mortification. He was a
model of monkish piety. He says, &ldquo;If ever a monk got to
heaven by monkery, I would have gotten there.&rdquo; No one
could surpass him in prayers by day and night, in fasting, in
vigils, self-discipline and self-mortification, and yet&mdash;had he
found what his soul was looking for? There is no mistake.
He is as far from peace of conscience as ever. He read
the Bible, but a veil was before his eyes. Christ was still
to his mind a merciless judge. The righteousness of God,
which, according to Paul, was revealed in the Gospel, he took
to mean the righteousness which metes out just punishment.</p>
<p>Finally, John Staupitz, the vicar-general of the Augustinian
order, a man of sympathetic nature, and one who possessed
in a singular degree the power to discern and appreciate
the needs of whomsoever applied to him for aid, came
to his rescue. Looking into the haggard face of Luther,
he said: &ldquo;Brother, you must obey God and believe in forgiveness.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You have altogether a wrong idea of Christ.
Christ does not terrify; his office is to comfort.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
must make up your mind that you are a very sinner, and
that Christ is a very Savior.&rdquo; These were starting points
for new currents of thought. They shed light upon many
passages of scripture. For days and weeks Luther pondered
over these words: &ldquo;The Gospel is the power of God unto
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
salvation to every one that believeth; ... For therein
is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith:
as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith&rdquo; (Rom.
1:16, 17). Many years after receiving this help, Luther
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Dr. Staupitz, or, rather, God, through Dr. Staupitz, had
not aided me in this, I would have been long since in hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luther now devoted himself earnestly to the study of
theology. Among other writings, he read those of Augustine
more frequently and fixed them more thoroughly in
his memory than any others. In 1508 his scholarship received
acknowledgement by a call to the chair of philosophy
in the newly-founded University of Wittenburg. As a
professor he made rapid progress, and soon reached a position
of great responsibility and influence.</p>
<h4 id="c39">MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO ROME</h4>
<p>&ldquo;To make a pilgrimage to Rome; to confess in the Holy
City all his sins committed from early youth; to visit the
many sacred places, sacred to the memory of saints and
martyrs; to avail himself of the rich influences offered there;
to read mass in Rome&mdash;had been a long-cherished hope of
the young monk. Hardly had he dared to look for its
realization.&rdquo; But all of a sudden he was sent by Staupitz
to Rome to assist in the settlement of some difficulties which
had arisen in the management of the monastic order. On
foot, from monastery to monastery, he and his companion
went across the Alps, and by the picturesque plain of Lombardy
passed into Italy. Everywhere his eyes were opened,
and important lessons for the future were learned.</p>
<p>The first sight of Rome inspired him with great enthusiasm.
It was a great moment to him. He fell upon the
ground, and, with outstretched hands, exclaimed, &ldquo;Hail, thou
Holy City!&rdquo; The visit continued four weeks, giving him
ample time to see the ruins of the Colosseum, the Baths of
Dioclesian, the Pantheon, and other remains of past glory.
He visited also the catacombs and other places made sacred
by the sufferings of martyrs, and, above all, those churches
and shrines where &ldquo;special grace&rdquo; could be obtained.</p>
<p>The chief attraction, however, was not that of sight-seeing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
but the spiritual blessings that he hoped to receive.
It was his purpose to make while there an unreserved confession
of all the sins that he had ever committed. Although
he had made such confession twice before at Erfurt, he
expected an especial blessing from the same confession, if
made in the &ldquo;Holy City.&rdquo; Mass he celebrated a number of
times, and actually wished that his parents were dead, because,
by such services at Rome, he thought that he could
have been able to deliver them from purgatory.</p>
<p>But in all this he found no satisfaction for his mind;
on the contrary, there was aroused in him a consciousness
of another way to salvation which had previously taken root
in his heart. While he was painfully climbing on his knees
in devout prayer the steps of the identical staircase, as was
superstitiously believed, which formerly led up to the palace
of Pilate in Jerusalem&mdash;in order to receive the rich blessings
promised by several popes upon all who would perform
this meritorious deed&mdash;again and again as he struggled up
the stairway, the words of Paul&mdash;&ldquo;the just shall live by faith&rdquo;&mdash;came
to him as though uttered in tones of thunder. But
Luther never became sensible of any blessing.</p>
<p>Even Rome did not give to his soul the peace for which
he longed. On the contrary, his sojourn in the &ldquo;Holy City,&rdquo;
brief though it was, sufficed to convince him that Rome could
never supply the needs of his spiritual nature. The high
ideals of the sanctity of the worship of the saintly life of
the pope and the other ecclesiastical dignitaries, which filled
his own soul with aspirations and stimulated him to like endeavors,
were rudely shattered. What he saw and heard
in Rome was the very opposite of what he had expected.
Instead of piety he found levity; instead of holiness he met
lasciviousness; instead of seeing pure spirituality, he beheld
nothing but carnal-mindedness, greed and self-seeking. Religion
was but the cloak which covered up the shame and
vice. The white garments of the Church were polluted with
the stains of the most disgraceful and carnal manner of living.
Wherever he turned he saw hypocrisy and sin. Everything
that was to him an object of holy adoration was made
the butt of blasphemous jests. Of the impressions made on
his mind he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Nobody can form an idea of the licentiousness, vice and
shame that is in vogue in Rome. Nobody would believe it unless
he could see it with his own eyes and hear it with his own
ears. Rome was once the holiest city, now it is the vilest. It
is true what has been said, &ldquo;If there be a hell, Rome must be
built over it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in spite of all he saw and heard, he &ldquo;loved the grand
old Church&rdquo; with all his heart. He did not return from
Rome an enemy of the Church, nor even intending to reform
it. But if ever a man left the &ldquo;Holy City&rdquo; thrust down from
the heights of zeal and enthusiasm to the very depths of despair,
wounded and crushed in spirit, it was the plain, honest
Luther. This experience, however, was but another step
in his preparation, for he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not take a thousand florins for missing that visit
to Rome. I would constantly fear that I had wronged the
pope. But now I can speak of what I have seen myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c40">PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY AT WITTENBURG</h4>
<p>When Luther returned from Rome to Wittenburg in the
early summer of 1512, Staupitz sent him to Erfurt to complete
his training for the doctorate in theology. His advancement
was so rapid that by the time he reached his
twenty-ninth year he found himself not only installed in a
professorship of Theology at Wittenburg, but also with the
main responsibility resting upon him for all instruction that
was to be given. From that time the presence of Staupitz
was not frequent. In this position he did not hesitate to
break through all traditional modes of theological instruction.</p>
<p>Luther was still a genuine monk, with no doubt of his
vocation. He became the sub-prior of the Wittenburg Monastery
in 1512, and was made district vicar over eleven monasteries
in 1515. These administrative duties occasioned
frequent interruptions of his professional and literary labors.
It was his duty, by means of visitations and frequent correspondence,
to learn the condition and decide concerning
the necessities of each monastery and its inmates. The already
thoroughly occupied professor was thus called to a
truly pastoral care of an extensive and difficult field. To
every one in doubts and perplexities, like those which agitated
him, he sought to give the full benefit of his experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>So far as the record shows, Luther first heard of Tetzel
in 1516, just as he was beginning his visitation of the
churches. It was reported to him that Tetzel was making
a great noise, and some of his extravagant sentiments, which
I have already quoted, were related to him, and when he
heard this he indignantly exclaimed, &ldquo;If God permit, I will
make a hole in his drum!&rdquo; Shortly after this he gave warning,
not against indulgences, but what he regarded their
abuse. &ldquo;What should be regarded with all reverence,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;has become a horrid means of pampering avarice, since
it is not the salvation of souls, but solely pecuniary profit
that is in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He justified the intentions of the pope, but charged that
Tetzel had misinterpreted and misapplied them. In a sermon
delivered February 24, 1517, he grows in severity.
&ldquo;Indulgences,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;are teaching the people to dread
the punishment of sin, instead of sin itself. If it were not
to escape the punishment for sin, no one would care about
indulgences, even if offered gratuitously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tetzel drew near to Wittenburg, attracting larger
crowds to his preaching, and as some over whom Luther had
spiritual jurisdiction sought to excuse themselves from worshiping
of relict and of engaging in revolting sins by producing
letters of indulgence obtained from Tetzel, he could
not, by silence, connive at what would have carried with it
the violation of his fidelity as a spiritual guide. Still it was
only after much hesitation, after many of his friends had
urged him to interfere, and in deep distress of mind, that
he resolved to protest. When he had determined to do
something he went about the matter with a mixture of caution
and courage.</p>
<h4 id="c41">THE NINETY-FIVE THESES</h4>
<p>The Church of All-Saints in Wittenburg had always
been intimately connected with the university; its doors were
used as boards on which to publish important academic documents;
and notices of public &ldquo;disputations,&rdquo; common enough
at the time, had frequently appeared there. The day of the
year which drew the largest concourse of townsmen and
strangers to the church was All-Saints Day, so on the day
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
before, October 31, 1517, Luther nailed the Ninety-five
Theses protesting against what he regarded as the abuse of
indulgences, to the door of the church. Crowds of eager
students gathered for hours before the door of the church,
intent upon reading and copying the sensational document.
The first effect upon those nearest Luther was stunning.
Whatever their abhorrence of the methods of Tetzel, and
their dissatisfaction of the whole system which admitted
of such manifest abuses, the impression was that he had
spoken inadvisedly. His colleagues were apprehensive of
the results for the university. The Augustinian monks saw
the stake in the foreground, and dreaded the disgrace which
Luther&rsquo;s presence among them would cast upon their order.
For the moment, Luther stood alone at Wittenburg, but
copies of the Latin original and translations of it into German
were sent to the university printing house and the
presses could not print them fast enough to meet the demand
which came from all parts of Germany, and &ldquo;in four weeks
they were diffused throughout all Christendom, as though
the angels were the postmen.&rdquo; The result was unexpected
and startling to Luther.</p>
<p>Many approved Luther&rsquo;s course, saying that the man
who was to break the tyranny of the papacy had arisen. In
the meantime the opposition was industriously gathering its
forces, but the controversy increased the popularity of the
theses. Luther was summoned to Rome to answer for his
attack on the Indulgence system. To have disobeyed would
have meant death. This peremptory summons was construed
as an affront to the University of Wittenburg. The
officials of the university interfered, with the result that the
summons to Rome was canceled and it was arranged that
the matter was to be left in the hands of the Papal Legate
Cajetan in Germany, and Luther was ordered to present
himself before the official at Augsburg. The interview was
not satisfactory. The cardinal demanded that Luther should
recant his heresies without any argument. When pressed to
say what the heresies were, he named the statement in fifty-eighth
thesis that the merits of Christ work effectually without
the intervention of the pope, and that which said that the
sacraments are not efficacious apart from faith in the recipient.
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
There was some discussion, notwithstanding the cardinal&rsquo;s
declaration; but in the end Luther was ordered to
recant or depart. Luther appealed to a general council and
returned to Wittenburg.</p>
<p>On returning to Wittenburg Luther&rsquo;s first task was to
prepare for the press an account of his interview with Cardinal
Cajetan, the pope&rsquo;s representative at Augsburg. He
was careful to take the people of Germany into his confidence,
and published an account of every important interview
he had; thus the people were able to follow him step
by step, and he was never so far in advance that they were
unable to see his footprints. The immediate effect of the
report was an immense outburst of sympathy for him.</p>
<p>Soon after the interview at Augsburg, the papal court
reached the conclusion that it would be to their interest to
win him by compromise and kindness. Miltitz, a papal
chamberlain, was sent to Germany. On reaching there he
found that &ldquo;the state of matters was undreamt of at the
papal court.&rdquo; He saw that Cajetan had never perceived that
he had not only to deal with Luther, but with the slow movement
of the German nation. He found that three out of
five of the people stood with Luther. He wisely resolved
that he would see both Luther and Tetzel privately before
producing his credentials. Tetzel he could not see, for it
was dangerous for him to stir from his convent, so greatly
was he in danger from violence of the people. On meeting
Luther, he at once disowned the speeches of Tetzel; showed
that he was not pleased with Cajetan&rsquo;s methods of action;
and so prevailed on Luther that he promised to write a submissive
letter to the pope, to advise the people to reverence
the Roman Church, and to say that indulgences were useful
in the remission of canonical penances.</p>
<p>The letter was actually written and the language is replete
with expressions of condescension, and it exalts the
Roman Church above everything but Christ himself. He
also promised to discontinue the controversy if his opponents
would do the same. But Miltitz was not supported by
the Roman court, and he had also to reckon with John Eck,
who was burning with a desire to vanquish Luther in a
public discussion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The time between his interview at Augsburg and the discussion
with the vainglorious John Eck was spent by Luther
in hard and disquieting studies. His opponents had confronted
him with the pope&rsquo;s absolute supremacy in all ecclesiastical
matters, and this was one of his oldest inherited
beliefs. The Roman Church had been for him &ldquo;the pope&rsquo;s
house,&rdquo; in which the pope was the house-father, to whom
all obedience was due. It was hard for him to think otherwise.
He re-examined his convictions about justifying and
attempted to trace clearly their consequences, and whether
they did lead to his declarations about the efficacy of indulgences.
He came to no other conclusion. He also investigated
the evidence for the papal claim of absolute authority,
and found that it rested on the strength of a collection of
decretals many of which were plainly forgeries. Under the
combined influence of historical study, of the opinions of
the early &ldquo;church fathers,&rdquo; and of the Holy Scriptures, one
of his oldest landmarks crumbled to pieces. His mind was
in a whirl of doubt. He was half-exultant and half-terrified
at the result of his studies; and his correspondence
shows how his mind changed from week to week. &ldquo;It was
while he was thus &lsquo;on the swither,&rsquo; tremulously on the balance,
that John Eck challenged him to dispute at Leipzig
on the primacy and supremacy of the Roman pontiff.&rdquo;
Luther accepted the challenge, thinking that the discussion
might clear the air, and might enable him to see more clearly
where he stood.</p>
<h4 id="c42">DEBATES WITH JOHN ECK AND BURNS THE PAPAL BULL</h4>
<p>The discussion began June 27th and closed July 15,
1519. This is the first time Luther ever met a controversialist
of European fame. Eck came to Leipzig from his
triumphs at the great debates at Vienna and Bologna, and
was and felt himself to be the hero of the occasion. Eck&rsquo;s
intention was to force his opponent to make some declaration
which would justify him in charging Luther with being a
partisan of the medieval heretics, and especially of the Hussites.
He continually led the debate away to the Waldenses,
the Wycliffites, and the Bohemians. The audience was
swayed with a wave of excitement when Luther was gradually
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
forced to admit that &ldquo;the Hussite doctrines are not all
wrong.&rdquo; Throughout the debate Eck&rsquo;s deportment was that
of a man striving to overcome his opponent rather than one
striving to win a victory for the truth. There was as much
sophistry as good reasoning in his arguments; he continually
misquoted Luther&rsquo;s words or gave them a meaning they were
not intended to convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Triumphant, lauded by his friends, and recompensed
with favor and honor by Duke George, Eck departed from
the debate.&rdquo; He had done what he had meant to do. He
had made Luther declare himself. In his estimation, all
that was needed was a papal bull against Luther, and the
world would be rid of another pestilent heretic. He had
made him the central figure around which all the smoldering
discontent could gather. As for Luther, he returned to
Wittenberg, disgusted and full of melancholy foreboding.
This did not prevent him preparing and publishing for his
people an account of the discussion, which was eagerly read
and gained for him great favor. In some respects the Leipzig
debate was the most important point in the career of
Luther. It made him see for the first time what lay in his
opposition to indulgences. It made the people see it, too.
His attack was no criticism, as he had at first thought, of a
mere excrescence on the medieval ecclestiastical system. He
had struck at its center: at its ideas of priestly mediation
which denied the right of every believer to immediate entrance
into the very presence of God.</p>
<p>Great men now came to the support of Luther, including
Philip Melanchthon, one of the greatest scholars of the
age. The conflict between Rome and Luther became one
of life and death. In September, 1520, Eck again appeared
in Germany with a papal bull against Luther, dated June
15th. It condemned as heresies forty-one propositions extracted
from his writings, ordered his works to be burned
wherever they were found, and summoned him on pain of
excommunication, to confess and retract his errors within
sixty days, and to throw himself upon the mercy of the pope.
This bull fight brought Luther to a step decisive beyond recall.
He met this threat of violence with unshakable courage.
He at once &ldquo;carried the war into the heart of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
enemy&rsquo;s territory. In the presence of a vast multitude of
all ranks and orders, he burned the papal bull, and with it
the decree, the decretals, the Clementines, and extravagants,
the entire code of Romish canon law, as the root of all the
evil, December 10, 1520.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the news spread that a poor monk had burnt the
pope&rsquo;s bull, a thrill went through Germany, and, indeed,
throughout all Europe. Papal bulls had been burnt before
Luther&rsquo;s day, but the actors had for the most part been
powerful monarchs. This time it was done by a monk with
nothing but his faith and courage to back him.</p>
<p>Rome had now done its utmost to get rid of Luther by
ecclesiastical measures, and had failed. If he was to be
overthrown, if the new religious movement and the national
uprising which indorsed it were to be stifled, this could only
be done by the aid of the supreme secular authority. The
Roman court now turned attention to the emperor.</p>
<p>Emperor Maximilian died January 12, 1519, and after
some months of papal intriguing, his grandson, Charles, the
King of Spain, was chosen to be his successor. Troubles
in Spain prevented his leaving that country at once to take
possession of his new dignities. He was finally crowned on
October 20, 1520, and opened his first German diet, at
Worms, January 22, 1521.</p>
<p>After the coronation, and especially after the burning
of the pope&rsquo;s bull, every step was toward Worms. The decision
of the Roman court had not settled the case as to
Luther; the bull was slow in getting itself executed; very
many thought it were better not executed. Men&rsquo;s minds
were not at rest&mdash;they wished for some other tribunal to
which the case might be referred; in the absence of a general
council, the highest authority in the Roman Church,
they thought of the emperor and the diet, the highest authority
in the State. But if Luther were to appear before
the diet, it was not at all clear what the diet was to demand
of him or to do with him. There was no need that judgment
should be passed upon him; the pope had already condemned
him. It was not necessary that the diet should order his execution;
the bull made it the duty of any prince to do that
without any order. He might be required to retract his
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
teaching, but that had already been done by the bull. If
the diet should undertake to hear his cause, that would be a
virtual denial of the pope&rsquo;s supremacy, and an acknowledgment
of the justice of Luther&rsquo;s complaint that he had been
condemned unheard. Both parties felt that for the diet to
do anything was a reflection on the pope; and yet it was
evidently necessary for the diet to do something.</p>
<p>The emperor, too, felt the difficulty. He was a politician
from his youth, and his conduct toward the pope,
even from the first, was affected by political considerations;
but apart from these things, there was sufficient reason for
his hesitation and vacillation. He was influenced now by
one party now by the other or, as is likely, now by his own
independent judgment and now by what seemed to be required
of him by his position as the civil head of the Church.
On November 28, 1520, he wrote to the Elector of Saxony,
directing him to bring Luther to Worms, &ldquo;in order to give
him there a full hearing before the learned and competent
persons,&rdquo; and promising that no harm should come to him;
in the meantime, the elector was to require of Luther to
write nothing against the pope. The emperor was acting
on the suggestion of the elector, but between the time of
this suggestion and the time of the elector&rsquo;s receiving the
letter things had been changed&mdash;by the burning of his books
he had been treated as a condemned heretic. This offended
the elector, and he wrote the emperor declining to require
Luther&rsquo;s presence at the diet. The emperor, too, had
changed; he had begun to realize that Luther was under the
papal ban, and that any place in which he might be was declared
under the interdict. Luther, therefore, could not be
permitted to come to Worms. If he would not retract what
he had said against the papacy he was to stay at home until
the emperor should have opportunity to confer with the
elector personally.</p>
<h4 id="c43">BEFORE THE DIET OF WORMS</h4>
<p>The diet met on January 22, 1521, and on February 10th
there came a brief from Rome making final Luther&rsquo;s excommunication,
urging his condemnation by the diet and
emperor. But there was evident reluctance to proceed
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
against him; something might be accomplished by negotiations.
The pope had selected Marino Carraccioli and Jerome
Aleander to wait on the young emperor and to represent
his case before the diet. Aleander was a clearsighted, courageous
and indefatigable diplomatist, a pure worldling, a
man of indifferent morals, who believed that every man had
his price, and that law and selfish motives were alone to be
reckoned with. The defeat of the papacy at Worms was
not due to any lack of thoroughness of his work. He had
spies everywhere&mdash;in the households of the emperor and of
the leading princes, and among the population of Worms.
He did not hesitate to lie when he thought it useful to the
Roman Church. The Roman court had put upon him the
difficult task of putting Luther under the ban of the empire
at once and unheard.</p>
<p>His speech before the diet was long and eloquent, but
weakened by his bitterness and vehemence. He said he spoke
in defense of the papal throne, which was so dear to them
all. He enumerated the heresies taught in Luther&rsquo;s works.
Luther was obstinate, disobedient to the pope&rsquo;s summons,
refused to be instructed; the pope had condemned him, and
it was the emperor&rsquo;s duty to enforce the condemnation; the
laity had nothing to do with such questions except to carry
out the pope&rsquo;s decrees; ruin would follow if Luther was
not condemned; a decree from the diet and the emperor
would restore quiet, and preserve the Church and empire.
Such were the considerations urged by Aleander. He sat
down amid murmurs of approbation, but he had made no
new points, given no fresh reasons.</p>
<p>A few days afterward a representative German, Duke
George of Saxony, already Luther&rsquo;s enemy, presented the
case of Germany against the pope. There were many things
of which he complained, exactions and usurpations, the
growth and accumulation of years. A committee of the
diet was appointed to draft the grievances, and brought in
a long list. With so many grievances against the pope already
the diet was in no hurry to take the pope&rsquo;s part against
a popular German; the condemnation of Luther, and especially
the manner of condemnation, was itself another
grievance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The law required the execution of the pope&rsquo;s bull, and
was against granting to a condemned heretic a new hearing
before a secular tribunal. It was a case in which the law
demanded one thing and expediency and justice another.
After a long discussion in the diet it was &ldquo;held stoutly that
no countryman of theirs should be placed under the ban of
the empire without being heard in his defense, and that they
and not the pope of Rome were to be the judges in the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was open opposition between the emperor and the
diet, and abundant secret intrigue&mdash;&ldquo;an edict proposed against
Luther, which the diet refused to accept; an edict proposed
to order the burning of Luther&rsquo;s books, which the diet also
objected to; this edict revised and limited to seizure of
Luther&rsquo;s writings, which was also found fault with by the
diet; and, finally, the emperor issuing this revised edict of
his own authority and without the consent of the diet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command to appear before the diet on April 16,
1521, and the safe conduct were delivered to Luther on
March 26th. He was to face in a practical way the question
of going to the diet, and for him and his friends the
crisis had come. Many of Luther&rsquo;s associates at Wittenberg
endeavored to dissuade him from obeying the emperor&rsquo;s
mandate. Well it was for his fame, work and cause that
he refused to heed their advice. These good-intentioned,
but faint-hearted, colleagues were advising him to take a
fatal step, one that would have been more damaging to his
work than all the machinations of his foes; that would, in
fact, have been playing his enemies&rsquo; game, and bringing the
Reformation in Germany to a sudden close. A crisis had
been reached where a failure in moral courage in Luther
would have ruined everything. He rose to the occasion,
and his moral stature was disclosed to the whole world.</p>
<p>The journey seemed to the indignant papists like a royal
progress; crowds came to bless the man who had stood for
the people against the pope, and they believed he was going
to his death for his courage. The nearer he came to Worms,
the fiercer became the disputes there. Friends and foes
found that his presence would prove oil thrown into the
flames. The emperor regretted having sent the summons.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
Messengers were dispatched secretly to endeavor to prevent
his coming. Just as he was approaching the city a messenger
from one of his best friends in great alarm said:
&ldquo;Do not enter Worms!&rdquo; But Luther, undismayed, turned
to him and said: &ldquo;Go and tell your master that even should
there be as many devils in Worms as tiles on the housetops,
still I would enter it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morning of April 16th Luther entered the city,
accompanied by fully two thousand persons. The citizens
eagerly pressed forward to see him, and every moment the
crowd was increasing. It was much greater than the public
entry of the emperor. The news of his arrival filled both
friend and foe with great alarm. On the next morning the
&ldquo;marshal of the empire cited him to appear at four o&rsquo;clock
before his imperial majesty and the states of the empire.&rdquo;
Luther received this summons with profound respect. Thus
everything was arranged. At four o&rsquo;clock the marshal appeared,
and Luther set out with him. He was agitated at
the thoughts of the solemn congress before which he was
about to appear. The streets were so densely crowded that
they advanced with great difficulty. At length they reached
the doors of the hall, which were opened to them. Luther
went in, and with him entered many persons who formed no
portion of the diet. And now was enacted &ldquo;the most splendid
scene in history.&rdquo; As has been aptly said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never had man appeared before so imposing an assembly.
The Emperor Charles V, whose sovereignty extended over a
great part of the old and new world; his brother, Archduke
Ferdinand; six electors of the empire, most of whose descendants
now wear the kingly crown; twenty-four dukes, the majority
of whom were independent sovereigns over countries more
or less extensive, and among whom were some whose names
afterward became formidable to the Reformation&mdash;the Duke of
Alva and his two sons; eight margraves, thirty archbishops,
bishops, and abbots; seven ambassadors, including those from
the kings of France and England; the deputies of ten free
cities; a great number of princes, counts, and sovereign barons;
the papal nuncios&mdash;in all two hundred and four persons. Such
was the imposing court before which appeared Martin Luther.
The appearance was of itself a signal victory over the papacy.
The pope had condemned the man, and yet there he stood before
a tribunal which by this very act, set itself above the
pope. The pope had laid him under an interdict, and cut him
off from all human society; and yet he was summoned in respectful
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
language, and received before the most august assembly
in the world. The pope had condemned him to perpetual
silence, and yet he was now about to speak before thousands
of attentive hearers drawn together from the farthest parts
of Christendom. An immense revolution had thus been effected
by Luther&rsquo;s instrumentality. Rome was already descending
from her throne, and it was the voice of a monk that caused
this humiliation. (D&rsquo;Aubigne&rsquo;s History of the Reformation,
p. 240.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Into the presence of this august body Luther was led,
and the sight of this great assemblage of dignitaries almost
paralyzed him. The marshal commanded him not to speak
unless he was spoken to, and to answer promptly and truly
all questions put to him. The court was conducted with
great pomp, but all its solemn apparatus was an empty
pageant; for however Luther might defend himself, the
sentence had been already arranged with Rome. Aleander
had arranged the procedure. After a moment of solemn
silence John Eck rose and said in a loud and clear voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther, his sacred and invincible imperial majesty
has cited you before his throne, in accordance with the advice
and counsel of the States of the holy Roman empire, to require
you to answer two questions: (1) Do you acknowledge these
books to have been written by you? [At the same time pointing
to twenty books on a table directly in front of Luther.]
(2) Are you prepared to retract these books, and their contents,
or do you persist in the opinions you have advanced in
them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was then requested that the titles of the books be read,
which was done, and Luther acknowledged them to be his.
He was again asked, &ldquo;Will you retract the doctrines therein?&rdquo;
Then Luther, after having briefly and precisely repeated
the questions put to him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can not deny that the books named are mine, and I will
never deny any of them; they are all my offspring. But as
to what follows, whether I shall reaffirm in the same terms all,
or shall retract what I may have uttered beyond the authority
of Scripture&mdash;because the matter involves a question of faith
and of the salvation of souls, and because it concerns the Word
of God, which is the highest thing in heaven and on earth, and
which we all must reverence&mdash;it would be dangerous and rash
in me to make any unpremeditated declaration, because in unpremeditated
speech I might say something less than the facts
and something more than the truth; besides, I remember the
saying of Christ when he declared, &ldquo;Whosoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
in heaven, and before his holy angels.&rdquo; For these reasons I
beg, with all respect, that your Imperial Majesty give me time
to deliberate, that I may answer the question without injury
to the Word of God and without peril to my own soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luther made his answer in such a low voice that those
who were sitting near him could scarcely hear him. Many
present inferred that Luther&rsquo;s low voice indicated that his
spirit was broken, and that he was greatly alarmed. But
from what followed it is evident that Luther&rsquo;s whole procedure
on this first appearance before the diet was intended
to defeat the intrigues of Aleander, which had for their aim
to prevent Luther addressing the diet in a long speech; and
in this he succeeded.</p>
<p>The emperor expressed the opinion that the question was
one for which Luther ought to be prepared to make immediate
answer; but after much delay and consultation with
his advisers he granted Luther&rsquo;s request for a postponement
until the next day at the same hour. Then he was required
to present himself before the diet on April 18th. After he
had been called on the following day, Eck began by reproving
him for asking for further time for consideration, and then
proceeded to put a second question, somewhat modified and
more in conformity to the ideals of the States: &ldquo;Will you
defend all the books that you have acknowledged as your
own, or recant some of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther had now freed himself from the web of intrigue
that Aleander had so skillfully woven around him to compel
him to silence, and stood forth a free German to plead
his cause before the most illustrious audience Germany could
offer to any of her sons, before which he made a deliberate
reply in a firm and decided tone. He divided his books into
three classes. The first were written for the edification of
believers, and his adversaries admitted them to be harmless,
and even useful. He could not retract these. Were he to
do it, he would be the only man doing so. In other books
he had attacked pernicious laws and doctrines of the papacy,
which, as no one could deny, tortured the consciences of
Christians and also tyrannically devoured the property of
the German nation; if he should recant these he would be
but adding to the force of the Roman tyranny, and opening,
not merely the windows, but the doors, to great impiety, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
make himself a disgraceful abettor of wickedness and oppression.
In the third place, he had written against persons who
defend and sanction this tyranny, and aiming at annihilating
these pious teachings; against them he said he had possibly
been more severe than he should have been, and that he did
not claim that his conduct had always been faultless. &ldquo;But
the question,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is not concerning my conduct, but
concerning the doctrine of Christ; and therefore I could not
recant these writings, for Rome would make use of such
disavowal to extend her oppression. I demand the evidence
against me, and a fair trial. I stand here ready, if any one
can prove me to have written falsely, to recant my errors,
and to throw my books into the fire with my own hands.&rdquo;
In conclusion he uttered an earnest admonition to the emperor,
and the empire, that instead of securing peace and
quiet by a condemnation of the divine Word, they would,
on the other hand, open the floodgate of untold miseries and
evils that can not be conceived. He did not mean to say that
his distinguished hearers required this admonition, but that
he could not refrain from discharging this duty in behalf
of his beloved Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a brave speech, a strong speech, delivered with
self-possession and in a clear voice that could be heard by
the whole assembly&mdash;a striking contrast in every way to
his manner of the previous day.&rdquo; When Luther had finished,
Eck addressed him in a threatening manner, and told
him that he had not answered the question; that this was not
an occasion for general discussion, but to ascertain from him
whether he would retract his errors. &ldquo;In some of your
books you deny the decision of councils and that they have
often erred and contradicted the Holy Scriptures. Will you
recant or reaffirm what you have said about them? The
emperor demands a plain answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Luther replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well then, since His Imperial Majesty wants a plain answer,
I will give him one without horns or teeth. Unless I
am convinced of error by the testimony of Scriptures or clear
arguments&mdash;for I believe neither the pope nor the councils
alone, which have erred and contradicted each other often&mdash;I
am convinced by the passages of Scripture which I have cited,
and my conscience is bound by the Word of God. I can not
and will not recant anything, for it is neither safe nor right
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
to act against one&rsquo;s conscience. Such is my profession of faith,
and expect no other from me. Here I stand, I can not do otherwise.
God help me, Amen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In astonishment, the emperor suggested the question
whether Luther actually was of the opinion that councils
could err, and he was promptly answered by Luther:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course; because they have often erred. For, since the
council of Constance decided in many points against the clear
text of Holy Scripture, Holy Scripture forces me to say that
councils have erred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eck declared that it could not be proved that general
councils had erred. Luther said he could prove they had.
The disputation that they said they would avoid was beginning.
The emperor, seeing this, arose, and all the assembly
with him. Eck cried out in a loud, clear voice: &ldquo;The diet
will meet again to-morrow to hear the emperor&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;
It was night; each man retired to his home in darkness.
Two imperial officers escorted Luther. Some supposed that
his fate was decided and that they were leading him to
prison, whence he would never return till he was brought
out to be burned at the stake. A great tumult arose. Some
cried out, &ldquo;Are they taking him to prison?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied
Luther, &ldquo;they are only accompanying me to my hotel.&rdquo; At
these words the excitement subsided.</p>
<h4 id="c44">UNDER IMPERIAL BAN</h4>
<p>Luther had produced a profound impression on the
chiefs of the empire, and many lords and princes were won
to his cause. On the next morning the emperor submitted
to the estates of the empire the proposition to immediately
dismiss Luther, and then on the expiration of his self-conduct,
to proceed against him as a heretic. On May 26th,
after a majority of the diet had departed from Worms,
an imperial edict against Luther was passed, and published
as the &ldquo;unanimous act of the Electors of the States.&rdquo; In
order to make it appear that the emperor&rsquo;s signature was
affixed when all the members of the diet were assembled,
it was dated May 8th. It decreed against Luther the imperial
ban; after applying to him the usual severe expressions
of the papal bulls, it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the pain of incurring the penalties due to the crime
of high treason, we forbid you to harbor the said Luther after
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the appointed term shall be expired, to conceal him, to give him
food or drink, or to furnish him, by word or by deed, publicly
or secretly, with any kind of succor whatever. We enjoin you,
moreover, to seize him, or cause him to be seized, wherever
you may find him, to bring him before us without any delay,
or to keep him safe in custody, until you have learned from us
in what manner you are to act toward him, and have received
the reward due to your labors in so holy a work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the diet of Worms added to the pope&rsquo;s excommunication
the ban of the emperor. The bold stand of the
poor monk, in the face of the combined civil and ecclesiastical
powers of the age, is one of the sublimest scenes in history,
and marks an epoch in the progress of freedom. The disaffections
with the various abuses of Rome and the desire
for free preaching of the Gospel were so extensive that the
Reformation, both in its negative and positive features,
spread in spite of the pope&rsquo;s bull and the emperor&rsquo;s ban, and
gained a foothold before 1530 in the greater part of Northern
Germany.</p>
<p>Among the principal causes of this rapid progress were
the writings of the reformers, Luther&rsquo;s German Bible, and
the evangelical hymns, which introduced the new ideas into
public worship and the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>On leaving Worms, after having gone some distance,
Luther dismissed the imperial herald and proceeded leisurely,
attended by only two friends. Toward night on May 4th,
as he was in a lonely part of the wood, a band of armed
horsemen suddenly appeared and surrounded the carriage.
His friends supposed themselves attacked by bandits; one
of them fled for his life, the other, Amisdorf, went on to
Wittenberg with the news that Luther was violently dragged
away and his fate was unknown. As the weeks passed and
nothing was heard of him, the people were filled with
anxiety. Even his enemies rejoiced with trembling when
they heard that he had disappeared, for things were in such
a state that &ldquo;Luther dead might well be more troublesome to
them than Luther living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther has left no record of his feelings when he was
dragged from his carriage, mounted on a horse and spirited
away. If he at first supposed himself to be a real captive
he was soon informed that he was in the hands of friends.
He was taken in the darkness and silence of the night to
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
the castle at Wartburg, eight miles distant, by the order of
the Elector Frederick, as a means of protecting him, where
he spent the next ten months. He doffed his monk&rsquo;s gown,
put on the garb of a country gentleman, let his beard grow,
and was known as &ldquo;Junker George.&rdquo; His time was spent
in meditation, translating the New Testament into German
and writing.</p>
<h4 id="c45">A CHANGE COMES OVER LUTHER</h4>
<p>At Wartburg he began that course of interference with
political administration and ecclesiastical organization which
made his later years as a reformer so different from his
earlier, and in the end led him to the practical denial of
nearly every principle that he had affirmed. His own protection
by the Elector Frederick against the combined power
of pope and emperor made clear to him, he thought, the
method by which a reformation might be attempted. While
at Wartburg he thought out and wrote what he entitled,
&ldquo;Warning to all Christians to Abstain from Rebellion and
Sedition,&rdquo; in which he maintained the principle from which
he never thereafter departed, that the civil Rulers had both
the right and the duty to undertake the reformation of the
church, and that any other principle was impracticable and
dangerous. That there be no mistaking his meaning I give
his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore have regard to the rulers. So long as they
undertake nothing and give no command, keep quiet with hand,
mouth and heart, and undertake nothing. If you can persuade
rulers to undertake and command, you may do it. If they will
not you should not. But if you proceed, you are wrong and
much worse than the other party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This no doubt was called forth by the news of the proceedings
at Wittenberg. For even with Luther away, Wittenberg,
with its growing, aggressive university, was the
center of the Reformation. New thoughts had been put
into men&rsquo;s minds, new aspirations, new purposes had come
into their hearts. Luther had long before preached that the
mass was wrong, but had gone right along celebrating it,
and so had he taught about other things, but continued to
practice them. His teaching had taken deep root, and
Zwilling, chaplain of the Augustinian convent, a bold, zealous
and eloquent man, who had the confidence of the people,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
declared that the mass ought to be abolished and that it was
a sin to celebrate it. &ldquo;The members of the convent, the
prior excepted, agreed with him. The prior asserted his
authority; the monks rebelled; the elector interfered and
referred the case to the university. The university decided
in favor of Zwilling and the monks, Melanchthon writing
the opinion.&rdquo; He attacked earnestly and bitterly monastic
vows, celibacy, clerical garb, the use of images and pictures
in the churches. His teaching strongly implied that liberty
could not be attained till all these things were swept away.</p>
<p>The movement to put these exhortations into practice
began first among the clergy. Two priests in parishes near
Wittenberg married; several monks left their cloisters and
donned the garments of the common people; Melanchthon
and several of his students &ldquo;communicated in both kinds
in the church,&rdquo; and his example was followed by others.
Images were condemned and cast out of the churches. No
one knew what would next be done, and disturbing rumors
were being circulated. Carlstadt now took the lead and
announced that on the first day of the new year he would
&ldquo;celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s Supper after the ancient manner in
both kinds. When opposition threatened he anticipated the
time and held the service on Christmas day. A beginning
was made; opposition was silenced and Carlstadt had his
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things were going too fast for the Elector Frederick,
too fast for Luther. In his quiet retreat in Wartburg he
wrote against the mass and monkish vows, &ldquo;but how great a
step there is between condemning old customs in our hearts
and changing them with our hands&mdash;between the thoughts
and the act!&rdquo; On being informed of the reformatory movements
in Wittenberg, Luther resented it, and most sharply
reproved them for practicing what he had preached. In a
letter written to the Wittenbergers in December, 1521, he
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have introduced changes in the mass and images, attacked
the sacrament and other things that are of no account,
and have let love and faith go; just as though all the world
hereabouts had great understanding in these matters, which is
not the fact; and so many have brought it about that many
pious people have been stirred up to do what is really the devil&rsquo;s
work. It would, indeed, be a good thing to begin such changes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
if we could all together have the needful faith; and if they
suited the church in such measure that no one could take offense
at them. But this can never be. We can not all be as Carlstadt.
Therefore we must yield to the weak; otherwise those
who are strong will run far, and the weak who can not follow
them at like pace will be run down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not by Luther, but by men of a different type, that
this practical work was begun. There was sore need for a
Zwilling and a Carlstadt. This was an occasion when those
who were called fanatics did a real service for mankind.
They were strong in their convictions, saw only one thing,
reckless of all consequences, and brave where other men are
appalled, and with no misgivings kindled a fire that wrapped
the world in flame. Had it not been for what they did,
&ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s writing and preaching might have ended in preaching
and writing. They saw that something must be done,
and they did it!&rdquo; While this was needful in precipitating
the conflict, it was equally necessary that others should
direct it.</p>
<p>The excitement at Wittenberg soon reached an alarming
height, and was intensified by the arrival of the Zwickan
prophets, who claimed to be the first to have properly received
the divine Spirit, and to have been called to carry
on God&rsquo;s work. They boasted of prophetic visions, dreams
and direct communications with God. They also rejected
infant baptism, saying that there was no such thing taught
in the Scriptures. The people, losing their hold on the
old, were ready to take up with anything that came with a
plausible face. Even the most prudent were afraid to condemn
anything that might have truth in it, and especially
were they unwilling to reject anything that seemed to be
taught in the Scripture. Melanchthon was greatly troubled
and disturbed. It was not so much the visions of the
Zwickan prophets that disturbed him as their teaching on
baptism, and instead of settling the matter by an appeal to
the Word of God, he referred it to the Elector Frederick,
who advised him not to discuss the subject with them, but
wait for Luther, for they quoted Saint Augustine to prove
that nothing could be brought in favor of infant baptism
except ecclesiastical custom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h4 id="c46">RETAINS THAT WHICH THE SCRIPTURES DO NOT EXPRESSLY FORBID</h4>
<p>Luther returned from Wartburg to Wittenberg in the
early part of 1522, when efforts were made to get him to drop
infant baptism and make the Reformation thorough. But
while translating the Bible, at Wartburg, he had determined
to retain whatever practices it did not forbid. At first he had
no little struggle on the subject of infant baptism. On other
subjects he had been forced, against his will, step by step,
to abandon the fathers, the councils, and Catholic tradition,
being driven to it by the Scriptures. But when he found no
authority in the Bible for infant baptism he assumed a new
attitude. At that point he had a fiery contest with himself
as to the true key of Biblical interpretation, and he deliberately
chose the negative turn. That is, he determined to
abide by what the Scriptures did not forbid, instead of by
what they enjoined. He saw at a glance where his rule of
interpretation on other subjects must inevitably lead him
on this point. And he dared not venture one step further
in free thought, for fear of invoking a complete revolution.
To take one step more was to let infant baptism go and the
State church with it. But this was not the kind of a church
Luther wanted, so he dismissed the whole matter as a very
inopportune question. Thus it appears that he was willing
to do as a positive duty to God whatever the Scriptures did
not prohibit, as in the Supper, when asked, &ldquo;What scripture
have you for elevating the cup?&rdquo; to which he indignantly
replied, &ldquo;What is there against it?&rdquo; By the same answer he
might have justified the offering of masses for the dead,
auricular confession, purgatory, infallibility of popes, and
any other unauthorized thing practiced by the Catholics, but
which the Scriptures had not positively forbidden.</p>
<p>The imperial edict against Luther at the diet of Worms
could scarcely have been stronger than it was, and yet it was
wholly ineffective, for after Luther returned from his hiding
place to Wittenberg he went on tours of numerous places,
preaching to thousands, encouraging them in reformation,
and never felt any ill effects of the ban placed upon him.</p>
<p>The papal court made determined efforts to bring to
nought the efforts of Luther at the diet of Nurnberg, 1522-1523,
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
but with no success, for they were compelled to say
that &ldquo;among a thousand men scarcely one could be found untainted
by Lutheran teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the real separation into two
opposite camps really began at the diet of Spires in 1524,
although the real parting of the ways actually occurred after
the Peasants&rsquo; War. When Germany emerged from the
social revolution which perpetrated this war, it soon became
apparent that the religious question was still unsettled and
was dividing the country into two parties, and that both
held as strongly as ever to their distinctive principles. The
reason for the increased strain was the conduct of many of
the Romanist princes in suppressing the rebellion; and on
the other hand those princes who favored Luther&rsquo;s teaching
had a mutual understanding to defend one another against
the attack upon their faith.</p>
<h4 id="c47">ORIGIN OF PROTESTANTISM</h4>
<p>When the diet met at Spires in 1526 it was apparent that
the national hostility to Rome had not abated. The grievances
of Germany against the Roman court were again revived,
and it was alleged, as it was in fact, that the chief
causes of the Peasants&rsquo; War were the merciless exactions of
clerical landholders. In the absence of Charles V, who was
at war with France, Ferdinand of Austria presided over the
diet. &ldquo;He demanded the enforcement of the edict of Worms
and a decree of the diet to forbid all innovations in worship
and in doctrine,&rdquo; but the diet was not inclined to adopt the
suggestions. Luther&rsquo;s followers were in the majority, and
the delegates from the cities insisted that it was impossible
to enforce the edict. The Committee of Princes proposed
to settle the religious question by a compromise which was
almost wholly favorable to Luther&rsquo;s teaching. It was decided
that &ldquo;the marriage of priests, giving the cup to the
laity, the use of the German as well as the Latin in the baptismal
and communion services, should be recognized; that
all private masses should be abolished; that the number of
ecclesiastical holy days should be largely reduced; and that
in the exposition of Holy Writ the rule ought to be that
scripture should be interpreted by scripture&rdquo;; and that each
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
State should so live as it hoped to answer for its conduct to
God and the emperor.</p>
<p>This was interpreted by those States favorable to the
Reformation that they had a legal right to organize territorial
churches and to make such changes in public worship as
would bring it into harmony with their beliefs. This gave
new life to the Reformation. Almost the whole North Germany
adopted the principles of the Reformation. Various
political intrigues caused division and discredit among the
reform party. When the diet again met at Spires in 1529,
the Roman Catholic party was largely in the majority. The
emperor at the outset declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my imperial and absolute authority I abolish the clause
in the ordinance of 1526 on which the Lutherans relied when
they founded their territorial churches; it has been the cause
of much ill counsel and misunderstanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of the diet upheld the emperor&rsquo;s decision,
and the practical effect of the ordinance was to rescind that
of 1526; re-establish Roman Catholic rule everywhere, and
with it the right of the bishops to direct all preachers in their
dioceses. This ordinance called forth the celebrated &ldquo;Protest,&rdquo;
which was read before the diet April 19, 1529, when
all concessions to the reformers had been refused. The
legal position taken was that the unanimous decision of the
diet in 1526 could not be rescinded by a majority. The
&ldquo;protesters&rdquo; declared that they intended to abide by the decision
of 1526, and not by that of 1529. They also declared
their readiness to obey the emperor and the diet in all &ldquo;dutiful
and possible matters, but any order considered by them
repugnant to God and his holy Word, to their soul&rsquo;s salvation,
and their good conscience,&rdquo; they appealed to the emperor,
to the free council, and to all impartial Christian
Judges. The essential principles involved in the protest
against this decree and in the arguments on which it was
grounded were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We protest publicly before God, our only Creator, Preserver,
Redeemer and Savior, who, as the only Searcher of all
our hearts, judgeth righteously, and we also protest before all
the world, that both for ourselves and for our connections and
subjects, we do not consent or agree with any resolutions or
acts contained in the last decree of Spires above referred to,
which, in the great concern of religion, are contrary to God
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
and to his holy word, injurious to our soul&rsquo;s salvation, and also
in direct opposition to the dictates of our conscience, as well as
to the degree issued by an imperial diet at Spires; and we
hereby solemnly declare that, from reasons already assigned,
and from other weighty considerations, we regard all such resolutions
or acts as null and void.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus in the presence of the diet spoke those courageous
men. This is the origin of the name &ldquo;Protestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So critical was the situation that the Protestants immediately
entered into an armed alliance for mutual defense. But
as the only object now was to secure mutual defense in
the right to have the same Gospel, the contest in progress
was not one in which all wrongs were to be righted, but one
in which they felt themselves justified in resistance only when
the emperor attacked that which they all were convinced was
of God.</p>
<p>An effort was made to perfect a union between the
Protestants in Germany, but without success, and a divided
Germany awaited the coming of the emperor. Charles V
was now at the zenith of his power, and was determined to
visit Germany and by his personal presence and influence
end the religious difficulty which was distracting that portion
of his vast dominions. He meant to use every persuasion
possible, to make what compromises his conscience permitted,
to effect a peaceful settlement. But if these failed
he was determined to crush the Reformers by force.</p>
<p>He summoned the diet to meet at Augsburg on April 8,
1530, but it was not formally opened till June 20th. In his
speech Charles V. announced that the assembly would be
invited to discuss armament against the Turk, and that his
majesty was anxious &ldquo;by fair and gentle means&rdquo; to end the
religious differences which were distracting Germany. The
Protestants were invited to give in writing their opinions
and difficulties which compelled them to forsake the Church
of Rome. It was resolved to take the religious question
first. By June 24th the Lutherans were ready with the
&ldquo;statement of their grievances and opinions relating to the
faith.&rdquo; On the following day it was read before the diet
by the Saxon Chancellor, Dr. Christian Bayer, in such a clear
voice that it was heard not only by those assembled within
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
the chamber, but by the crowd that thronged the court outside.</p>
<p>They were reviewed before the Protestant princes, and
it being deemed desirable that they should be extended and
enlarged, the work was assigned to Melanchthon; thus was
completed the famous Confession of Augsburg, the standard
of faith of all the Lutheran churches. When read before
the diet it produced a profound impression. It was
signed by four princes of the empire, by the imperial cities
of Nuremberg and Reutlingen, and by the Elector of Saxony.
Faber, Eckins and Cochl&aelig;us, who represented the Roman
court at the diet, drew up a refutation which was publicly
read before the diet, the emperor demanding the acquiescence
of the Protestants; for he was now determined to insist on
their submission, and to close the dispute. This they absolutely
refused. The emperor again took counsel with the
pope, and the result was an imperial edict commanding the
princes, States and cities which had thrown off the papal
yoke to return to their duty, on pain of incurring the displeasure
of the emperor as a patron and defender of the
Holy See.</p>
<p>The emperor published the decision on November 19th,
and the Protestants had to arrange some common plan for
facing the situation. They met, princes and delegates of
cities, in the town of Smalkald, December 22d to 31st, when
they formed a religious alliance, to which they invited England,
Denmark and other States in which the Reformation
had now dawned, to join them. In 1532 the peace at Nuremberg
composed for a time the differences between the emperor
and the reformers; the Lutherans were permitted the
free exercise of their worship until a general council or
another diet should finally determine the faith of &ldquo;Continental
Christendom.&rdquo; In 1535 the pope, Paul III, proposed
to summon a general council at Mantau. The Protestants
of Germany, well satisfied that no advantages would
result from such a synod, assembled at Smalkald in 1537,
and published a solemn protest against the constitution of
the council as partial and corrupt. To this they added a
summary of their doctrine, drawn up by Luther, in order
to present it to the council, if the pope should persist in calling
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
it together. This summary, which was distinguished by
the title of the &ldquo;Articles of Smalkald,&rdquo; is generally joined
with the creeds and confessions of the Lutheran Church.
The pope, however, died and the council at Mantau was
postponed. New projects were raised, with the vain hope
of setting at rest the spirit of religious freedom by which
all Germany was now disturbed. The emperor summoned
a conference at Worms in 1541, and Melanchthon disputed
three days with Eckins on the points at issue. A diet followed
at Ratisbon, another at Spires in 1542, and a third
was held at Worms in 1545; the emperor vainly attempting
to intimidate the Protestants, or to induce their leaders to
consent to a general council to be summoned by the pope.
But their resolution was fixed: they denied the pope&rsquo;s right
to call a general council; they regarded the proposal as a
snare, and treated it with scorn.</p>
<p>The Council of Trent met in 1546, but the Protestant
representatives appeared. It thundered its decrees, and the
Protestant princes of Germany bade it defiance. The emperor,
exasperated by their resistance and stimulated by the
pope, assembled his forces, resolved to crush the spirit he
could not otherwise subdue. All Germany was arming in
defense of Protestantism or in submission to the emperor,
and the storm darkened on every side. Such was the state
of Germany when Luther died, February 18, 1546.</p>
<p>A religious war now broke out. The emperor was victorious
and the Interim followed. This was an imperial
edict, issued in 1547, guaranteeing certain concessions more
specious than really important, to the Protestants, until the
decisions of a general council should be given. It satisfied
neither party, and the war soon raged anew. The emperor
was defeated by the German confederate, under
Maurice of Saxony, in 1552, and the pacification of Passau
followed. At last, in 1555, the diet of Augsburg met, peace
was restored, and the Protestant States of Germany secured
their independence. It was decreed that the Protestants
who embraced the Confession of Augsburg should be entirely
exempt from the jurisdiction of the pope of Rome, and
from the authority and interference of his bishops. They
were free to enact laws for the regulation of their own
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
religion in every point, whether of discipline or doctrine.
Every subject of the German empire was allowed the right
of private judgment, and might unite himself with the church
he preferred; and those who should prosecute others under
the pretext of religion were declared enemies of the common
peace.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Religious Peace of Augsburg&rdquo; has been claimed,
and justly so, as a victory for religious liberty. The victory
lay in this, that the first blow had been struck to free mankind
from the fetters of Rome; that the first faltering step
had been taken on the road to religious liberty; and the
first is valuable not for what it is in itself, but for what it
represents and for what comes after it. It is always the
first step that counts.</p>
<p>The German Reformation was a vast stride from Rome,
but it fell far short of a return to Jerusalem. About the
best that can be said is that the Reformation was a change
of masters; a voluntary one, no doubt, in those who had
any choice; and in this sense an exercise, for the time, of
their personal judgment. But as soon as the Augsburg
Confession of Faith was written no one was at liberty to
modify or change it, and those who did not conform to it
were no less heretics than Luther had been when he failed
to conform to the behests of Rome.</p>

<h3 id="c48">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND</span></h3>
<p>Hulerreich Zwingli, the Reformer of German Switzerland,
was born at Wildenhaus, January 1, 1484. In school
he made rapid progress and was soon recognized as a youth
of much promise. His bright mind, love of truth, and
devotion to the Scriptures soon brought him prominently
before the public. On discovering the corruptions of the
clergy, and learning of the dogmas and traditions, not found
in the Bible, such as indulgences, the worship of the &ldquo;Virgin&rdquo;
Mary and of images, he attempted to reform the Roman
Catholic Church. This soon caused charges of heresy to
be brought against him, for his influence was subversive of
the established order of things.</p>
<p>In a discussion held in the Town Hall at Zurich, January
29, 1523, in the presence of more than six hundred
persons, the entire clergy of the canton and large numbers
of the laity, Zwingli presented reformatory doctrines he had
preached in sixty articles, and defended them so successfully
that &ldquo;the council at Zurich charged all the preachers
to preach the pure gospel in the same manner.&rdquo; Soon after
Zwingli received an efficient co-laborer in his reformatory
efforts by the appointment of Leo Pudea, as Lent priest in
Zurich. Several events signalized at this time the cause of
the Reformation. The council allowed nuns to leave their
convents, several of the clergy married without hindrance,
a German baptismal service was introduced, and the cathedral
chapter, at its own request, received new and suitable ordinances.</p>
<p>The council decided that the time was ripe for a second
public discussion, to be held October 26, 27, 1523. More
than eight hundred and fifty persons were present, of whom
more than three hundred and fifty were clergymen. On
the first day, Zwingli set forth his views on the presence of
images in churches, and appealed to the council to forbid
their use. No champion for their use was found, and the
council decided that the images and pictures should be removed
from the churches, but without disturbance. On
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
the second day the following proposition was discussed:
&ldquo;The mass is no sacrifice, and hitherto has been celebrated
with many abuses, quite different from its original institution
by Christ.&rdquo; As no champion for images and mass was
found, the Council of Zurich concluded to promote the
reformation of the canton by diffusing the proper instruction
in the country districts, for which purpose Zwingli drew
up and published his &ldquo;Christian Introduction,&rdquo; which explained
to the people the meaning of the Reformation. Soon
after this the council remodeled the public worship according
to the views set forth by Zwingli. While Luther favored
the retention of everything in the practice of the church of
Rome not forbidden by the Scriptures, Zwingli contended
that nothing should be practiced that was not expressly commanded
by the Scriptures. On this difference between
Luther and Zwingli, D&rsquo;Aubigne says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Swiss Reformation here presents under an aspect
somewhat different from that of the German Reformation.
Luther had risen up against the excesses of those who had
broken the images in the churches of Wittenberg; and in
Zwingli&rsquo;s presence the idols fell in the temples of Zurich. This
difference is explained by the different lights in which the two
reformers viewed the same object. Luther desired to retain in
the church all that was not expressly contrary to the Scriptures,
and Zwingli to abolish all that was opposed to the Word
of God. The Zurich reformer passed over those ages, returned
to the apostolic times, and carrying out an entire transformation
of the church, endeavored to restore it to its primitive
condition. (History of the Reformation, p. 401.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Zwingli reduced the church service &ldquo;to extreme
simplicity; pictures and statues were removed from the
churches, on the assumption that their presence was contrary
to the Ten Commandments; organs were banished,
and sacred music disparaged as interfering with spirituality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Zurich the Reformation spread, and soon Zwingli
was joined by &OElig;colampadius, who was a great leader and
counselor. The majority of the cantons were, however, still
opposed to the Reformation, and the act of Lucerne (January,
1525) endeavored to satisfy the longing for a reformation
without rending the church. Its decrees did not, however
go into effect; and the Catholic cantons, in accordance
with the advice of Dr. Eck, arranged a new religious discussion
at Baden, which began May 10, 1526. &OElig;colampadius
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
was the spokesman in behalf of the Reformation. Though
both sides claimed the victory, the Reformation continued
to make progress. As the most zealous of the Catholic
cantons resorted to forcible measures for the suppression
of the Reformation, Zurich and Constance formed, December
25, 1527, a defensive alliance under the name of
&ldquo;Burgher Rights.&rdquo; Later on this alliance was joined by eight
other cantons. In the meanwhile five Catholic cantons had
concluded to league with King Ferdinand for the maintenance
of the Catholic faith. A war declared by Zurich in
1529 against the five cantons was of short duration, and
the peace was favorable to the Reformation. In 1531 the
war was renewed. Zurich had lost somewhat of its earlier
evangelical purity, while the neighboring cantons were conspiring
for its ruin.</p>
<p>In the awful emergency, when the public mind was
alarmed, Zwingli maintained tranquility. The war began,
but Zurich was dilatory, and far from being prepared; but
the horn of the enemy echoed among the hills, and Zwingli
bade farewell to his wife and children, mounted his horse
and went forth as a warrior to share the common danger.
The reformers were defeated with great slaughter, October
11, 1531. Zwingli was found after the battle, lying on his
back, and his eyes upturned to heaven, with his helmet on
his head, and his battle-ax in his hand. He had been struck
near the commencement of the engagement, and then, as
he reeled and fell, he was several times pierced with a lance.
He was living when discovered in the evening, but the infuriated
fanatics soon dispatched him. Next day his body
was barbarously quartered and burned. The Protestants
had provoked a contest for which they were not prepared,
and the blow given at Cappel checked for a time the general
progress of the Reformation in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In French Switzerland, the reformatory movement began
in 1526, in Berne and Biel, where William Farel preached.
In 1530 he established the Reformation in Neufchatel.
In Geneva a beginning was made as early as 1528; in 1534,
after a religious conference held at the suggestion of the
reformers at Berne, in which Farel defended the Reformation,
public worship was allowed to the reformers. Rapid
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
progress was made through the zeal of Farel, Fromdnt, and
Viret; and in 1535, after another discussion, the papacy was
abolished by the council and the principles of the Reformation
adopted.</p>
<p>In 1536 John Calvin arrived at Geneva and was induced
by Farel to remain in the city and to aid him in his struggle
against a party of free-thinkers. On July 20, 1539, the
citizens renounced the papacy and professed Protestantism.
Prior to this a reaction of the popish and conservative elements
in the State led to such dissensions and opposition
that Calvin and Farel were banished; but the earnest petition
of the citizens and rulers at Geneva at last induced them
to return in 1541. On his return Calvin set about modeling
the policy of the reformers in Geneva on the principles of
Presbyterianism, the theory which he had wrought out, and
commenced the dissemination of that theological system
which bears his name. Both his theology and church polity
became dominant throughout Switzerland.</p>
<p>The theological academy of Geneva, founded in 1588,
supplied the churches of many foreign countries, especially
France, trained in the spirit of Calvin. When Calvin died,
in 1564, the continuation of his work devolved upon Theodore
Beza. Calvin disagreed in many points with Zwingli,
whose views gradually lost ground as those of Calvin advanced.
The second Helvetic Confession, the most important
among the symbolic books of the Reformed Church,
which was compiled by Bullinger in Zurich, published in
1566, and recognized in all reformed countries, completed
the supremacy of Calvin&rsquo;s principles over those of Zwingli.</p>
<p>Although the majority of German Protestant Churches
remained in connection with the Lutheran Reformation, a
German Reformed Church, which bore a moderately Calvinistic
aspect, sprang up in several parts of Germany. In
1650 the Elector Frederick II, of the Palatine, embraced
the reformed creed, and organized the church of his dominions
according to reformed principles. By his authority
the Heidelberg Catechism, which soon came to be regarded
not only as a standard symbolical book of the German Reformed
Church, but was highly esteemed throughout the
reformed world, was written.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h3 id="c49">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE REFORMATION IN ENGLAND</span></h3>
<p>To say that the Reformation in England was brought
about by the desire of Henry VIII to be divorced from
Catharine of Aragon is to ignore the well-established facts
of history. No king, however despotic, could have forced
on such a revolution unless there was much in the life of
the people that reconciled them to the change, and evidence
of this is abundant.</p>
<p>There was much that was called &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; in England
long before Luther raised his voice against Catholicism in
Germany. Wycliffe&rsquo;s writings and translations of the
Scriptures into English had a tremendous influence on the
people in England and for many years the fires of martyrdom
were kept burning in the mad endeavor to stop the spread
of the &ldquo;heresy,&rdquo; and so great was the exasperation that
forty years after the death of Wycliffe Romanists dug up
his bones and burned them, and still the &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; spread.
As I have already shown in a former article, the work of
Tyndale, &ldquo;who won a martyr&rsquo;s crown,&rdquo; had a wonderful
influence over the English people.</p>
<p>In the Dictionary of National Biography, Dr. Rashdall
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is certain that the Reformation had virtually broken out
in the secret Bible readings of the Cambridge reformers before
either the trumpet call of Luther or the exigencies of
Henry VIII&rsquo;s personal and political position set men free once
more to talk openly against the pope and the monks, and to
teach a simpler and more spiritual gospel than the system
against which Wycliffe had striven. (Wycliffe, Vol. 63, p. 218.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Parliaments showed themselves anti-clerical long
before Henry threw off his allegiance to Rome; and Englishmen
could find no better term of insult to throw at the
Scots than to call them &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s men.&rdquo; These, and many
other things that might be mentioned, indicate a certain
preparedness in England for the Reformation, and that
there was a strong national force behind Henry, when he
at last decided to defy the Pope of Rome. The possibility
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
of England breaking away from papal authority and erecting
itself into a separate church under the archbishop of
Canterbury had been thought probable before the divorce
precipitated the quarrel between Henry and the pope.</p>
<p>Henry clung strenuously to the conception of papal
supremacy, and advocated it in a manner only done hitherto
by canonists of the Roman court. It is evident that the
validity of his marriage and the legitimacy of his children
by Catharine of Aragon depended on the pope being in
possession of the very fullest powers of dispensation. Henry
had been married to Catharine under very peculiar circumstances,
which suggested doubts about the validity of the
marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>To make the alliance stronger between England and
Spain the pope had a marriage arranged between Arthur,
Prince of Wales, and Catharine, the daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella of Spain. The wedding took place in St. Paul&rsquo;s,
November 14, 1501, but Arthur died April 2, 1502, and it
was proposed from the side of Spain that the young widow
should marry Henry, her brother-in-law, now Prince of
Wales. Ferdinand insisted that if this was not done Catharine
should be sent back to Spain and her dowry returned.
Pope Julius II was then besieged to grant a dispensation
for the marriage. At first he refused to give his consent.
Such a marriage had been branded as a sin by canonical law,
and the pope himself had grave doubts whether it was competent
for him to grant a dispensation in such a case; but
he finally yielded to the pressure and granted the dispensation.
The archbishop of Canterbury, who doubted whether
the pope could grant dispensation for what was a mortal
sin in his eyes, was silenced. The marriage took place June
11, 1509.</p>
<p>The first four children were either stillborn or died soon
after birth; and it was rumored in Rome as early as 1514
that Henry might ask to be divorced in order to save England
from a disputed succession. Mary was born in 1516
and survived, but all the children who came afterwards were
either stillborn or died soon after birth. There is no doubt
that the lack of a male heir troubled Henry greatly. There
seems to be no reason for questioning the sincerity of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
doubts about the legitimacy of his marriage with Catharine,
or that he actually looked on the repeated destruction of his
hopes of a male heir as a divine punishment for the sin of
that contract. Questions of national policy and impulses of
passion quickened marvelously his conscientious convictions.
In the perplexities of his position the shortest way out seemed
to be to ask the pope to declare that he had never been
legally married to Catharine. He fully expected the pope
to grant his request; but the pope was at the time practically
in the power of Charles V, to whom his aunt, the injured
Catharine, had appealed, and who had promised her his protection.
From the protracted proceedings in the divorce
case, Henry learned that he could not depend on the pope
giving him what he wanted; and although his agents fought
the case in Rome, he at once began preparing for the separation
from papal jurisdiction. In the meantime, Henry had
taken measures to summon a parliament; and in the interval
between summons and assembly it had been suggested
that Cranmer was of the opinion that the best way to
deal with the divorce was to take it out of the hands of the
pope and lay it before the canonists of the various universities
of Europe. Through Cranmer this was so successfully
done that the universities of England, France and Italy
decided that the marriage was null and void. The king
separated from Catharine, married Anne Boleyn, and fell
under the papal ban.</p>
<p>Parliament sundered the connection between England and
Rome, and passed an act declaring that the king was &ldquo;their
singular protector and only supreme lord, and, as far as
that is permitted by the law of Christ, the Supreme Head
of the Church and of clergy.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s desire was to destroy
the influence of the pope over the Church of England,
to which, in other respects, he wished to preserve the continuity
of its Catholic character; but it was impossible, however,
for the Church of England to maintain exactly the
same place which it had occupied. There was too much
stirring of reformation life in the land. &ldquo;The cloisters were
subjected to visitation in 1535, and totally abolished in 1536;
and the Bible was diffused in English in 1538 as the only
source of doctrine; but the statute of 1530 imposed distinct
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
limits upon the Reformation, and in particular confirmed
transubstantiation, priestly celibacy, masses for the dead,
and auricular confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Henry died in 1547 the English Church was
Roman in appearance. Excepting the litany in English, he
left the ritual very much as he found it, as he did nearly the
whole framework of religious belief. He was, however, the
instrument whereby three great barriers to improvement&mdash;the
papacy, monasticism, and Biblical ignorance&mdash;were
broken down. The course of national events during Henry&rsquo;s
latter years prepared the country for that reformation which
it subsequently embraced.</p>
<p>A remarkable thing connected with the issuing of the
Bible, in English, is that Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament, which
had been publicly condemned in England at the council called
by his majesty in May, 1530, and copies of it had been
burned in St. Paul&rsquo;s churchyard, while Tyndale himself had
been tracked like a wild beast by the emissaries of the English
Government in the Netherlands, was published in 1538,
by the king&rsquo;s command, to be &ldquo;sold and read by every person
without danger of any act, proclamation, or ordinance
heretofore granted to the contrary.&rdquo; Copies of it were
placed in the churches for the people to read, and portions
of it were read from the pulpit every Sunday.</p>
<p>When Henry died the situation was difficult for those
who came after him. A religious revolution had been half
accomplished; a social revolution was in progress, creating
popular ferment; evicted tenants and uncloistered monks
formed raw material for revolt; the treasury was empty,
the kingdom in debt, and the coinage debased.</p>
<h4 id="c50">CHANGES MADE BY EDWARD VI.</h4>
<p>Edward VI, &ldquo;a child in years, but, mature in wisdom,
intelligence and virtue,&rdquo; was crowned king, February 20,
1547. He collected learned men around him from every
quarter, and ordered the kingdom to be purged entirely of
popish fictions, and a better religion to be publicly taught.
On July 31st the council began the changes. A series of
injunctions was issued to the clergy, ordering them to preach
against &ldquo;the bishops of Rome&rsquo;s usurped power and jurisdiction;
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
to see that all images which had been objects of pilgrimages
should be destroyed; to read the Gospel and Epistles in
English during the service, and to see that the litany was
no longer recited or sung in processions, but said devoutly
kneeling.&rdquo; The council were evidently anxious that the
whole service should be conducted in English, and that a
sermon should always be a part of the service.</p>
<p>The first Parliament of Edward VI made great changes
in the laws of England affecting treason, which had the
effect of sweeping away the edifice of absolute government
which had been so carefully erected by Henry VIII. The
kingly supremacy in matters of religion was maintained, but
all heresy acts were repealed, giving the people an unwonted
amount of freedom. An act was passed ordaining that &ldquo;the
most blessed sacrament be hereafter commonly administered
unto the people ... under both kinds, that is to say, of
bread and wine, except necessity otherwise require.&rdquo; An
act was also passed permitting the marriage of the clergy.
The next important addition to the progress of the Reformation
was the preparation of a Service Book, commonly called
&ldquo;The First Prayer-Book of King Edward VI.&rdquo; It was
introduced by an &ldquo;Act of Uniformity,&rdquo; which, after relating
how there had been for a long time in England &ldquo;divers
forms of common prayer ... and that diversity of use
caused many inconveniences,&rdquo; ordains the universal use of
this one form, and enacts penalties on those who make use
of any other.</p>
<p>The changes made in the laws of England&mdash;the repeal
of the &ldquo;bloody statute&rdquo; and of the treason laws&mdash;induced
many of the English refugees who had gone to Germany
and Switzerland to return to their native land. These, with
other learned Protestants, who were invited to come to England,
were appointed as teachers in the English universities.
Thus the &ldquo;New Learning&rdquo; made great strides, leavening all
the more cultured classes, leading to the discredit of the
old theology, and gave a strong impulse to the Reformation
movement. The feeling of the populace changed rapidly,
for instead of resenting the destruction of images, they were
rather inspired by too much iconoclastic zeal.</p>
<p>In 1552, the &ldquo;Second Prayer-Book of King Edward VI.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
was issued. which was enforced by the second &ldquo;Act of
Uniformity,&rdquo; containing penalties against laymen as well as
clergymen&mdash;against &ldquo;a great number of people in divers
parts of the realm, who did willfully refuse to come to their
parish churches.&rdquo; Soon after there followed a new creed
or statement of the fundamental doctrines received by the
Church of England. This is interesting because they form
the basis of the &ldquo;Thirty-nine Articles,&rdquo; the creed of the
Anglican Church of today.</p>
<p>It was during the reign of Edward VI that Puritanism,
which became so prominent in the time of Elizabeth, first
manifested itself. Its two principal spokesmen were Bishops
Hooper and Ridley. Hooper was an ardent follower of
Zwingli, and was esteemed to be the leader of the party.
While the Reformation was being pushed forward at a speed
too great for the majority of the people, Edward died (July
6, 1553), and the collapse of the Reformation afterwards
showed the uncertainty of the foundation on which it had
been built.</p>
<h4 id="c51">&ldquo;BLOODY MARY&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII and Catharine of
Aragon, was crowned with great ceremony October 1, 1553,
and her first Parliament met four days later. It reversed
a decision of the former Parliament, and declared that
Henry&rsquo;s marriage with Catharine had been valid, and that
Mary was the legitimate heir to the throne; and it repealed
all the religious legislation under Edward VI. On taking
the throne Mary promised to force no one&rsquo;s religion, but as
soon as she dared she began to restore Romanism with a
zeal that delighted the pope.</p>
<p>Mary was married to Philip of Spain January 1, 1554;
but the alliance was very unpopular from the first. Immediately
after the marriage &ldquo;the bloody acts of the tragedy
were begun.&rdquo; Care was taken to elect to Parliament members
&ldquo;of a wise, grave and Catholic sort.&rdquo; This body obtained
the pope&rsquo;s absolution of the nation for its guilt of
schism and abolished all acts which made the sovereign the
supreme head of the Church. The Latin service was restored.
Fully half of the clergy were thrust out of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
offices. Bishop Gardner secured the passage of the terrible
edicts and laws, and Bishop Bonner so applied them as to
gain the title of &ldquo;the bloody.&rdquo; The fires of Smithfield and
the ax at the Tower were in such active service during four
years that some four hundred &ldquo;martyrs left their record of
faith and triumph as one of painful glories of the English
Reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among those burned were Latimer and Ridley. Bound
to the stake with his friend, Latimer said, when the lighted
fagot was applied: &ldquo;Be of good comfort, Master Ridley,
and play the man; we shall this day, by God&rsquo;s grace, light
such a candle in England as, I trust, shall never be put out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranmer had been the decisive agent in the divorce
against Catharine, thus branding the birth of her daughter,
Mary, as illegitimate. This Mary never forgave. But
there were other motives. &ldquo;To burn the Primate of the
English Church for heresy was to shut out meaner victims
from all hope of escape.&rdquo; He was more than any other man
the representative of the religious revolution which had
passed over the land. In an hour of weakness, and under
the entreaties of his friends, he recanted. But in the end
he redeemed his momentary weakness by a last act of heroism.
He knew that his recantations had been published, and
that any further declaration made would probably be suppressed
by his unscrupulous antagonists. He resolved by
a single action to defeat their calculations and stamp his
sincerity on the memories of his countrymen. His dying
speech was silenced, as he might well have expected; but he
had made up his mind to something that could not be stifled.
In his speech he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now I come to the great thing that so troubleth my
conscience, more than any other thing that I said or did in my
life: and that is my setting abroad of writings contrary to the
truth, which here now I renounce and refuse as things written
with my hand contrary to the truth which I thought in my
heart, and written for fear of death, and to save my life, if it
might be; and that is all such bills which I have written or
signed with mine own hand since my degradation; wherein I
have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand
offended in writing contrary to my heart, it shall be first burned.
And as for the pope, I refuse him as Christ&rsquo;s enemy and antichrist,
with all his false doctrine and as for the sacrament&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>He got no further; his foes had been dumb with amazement,
but now their pent-up feelings broke loose. &ldquo;Stop
the heretic&rsquo;s mouth!&rdquo; cried one; &ldquo;Take him away!&rdquo; cried
another; &ldquo;Remember your recantations and do not dissemble!&rdquo;
cried Lord Williams. &ldquo;Alas, my lord,&rdquo; replied Cranmer,
&ldquo;I have been a man that all my life loved plainness,
and never dissembled till now against the truth; for which
I am sorry;&rdquo; and he seized the occasion to add that as for
the sacrament, he believed that it should be administered in
&ldquo;both kinds.&rdquo; The tumult redoubled. Cranmer was
dragged from the stage and led to the place where Ridley
and Latimer had been burned.</p>
<p>The friars ceased not to ply him with exhortations: &ldquo;Die
not in desperation,&rdquo; cried one; &ldquo;Thou shalt drag innumerable
souls to hell,&rdquo; cried another. On reaching the appointed
place he was bound to the stake with a steel band,
and fire was set to the fagots of wood which made his funeral
pyre. As the flames leaped up, he stretched up his right
hand, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;This hand hath offended,&rdquo;
and held it firmly in the fire till it was consumed. No cry
escaped his lips and no movement betrayed his pain. If
the martyrdom of Ridley and Latimer lighted the torch,
Cranmer&rsquo;s spread the conflagration which in the end burnt
up the Roman Catholic reaction and made England a Protestant
nation.</p>
<p>The death of Cranmer was followed by a long succession
of martyrdoms. Mary tried most desperately to restore
Romanism in its fullness, but failed, and died November
17, 1558, &ldquo;the unhappiest of queens, and wives, and women.&rdquo;
The people who had welcomed her when she was crowned,
called her &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo;&mdash;a name which was, after all, so
well deserved that it will always remain. &ldquo;Each disappointment
she took as a warning from heaven that atonement
had not yet been paid for England&rsquo;s crimes, and the fires of
persecution were kept burning to appease the God of Roman
Catholicism.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c52">ELIZABETH, THE PROTESTANT QUEEN</h4>
<p>The people of England were coming to the conclusion
that Elizabeth must be queen, or civil war would result. It
seemed also assumed that she would be a Protestant. Many
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
things contributed to create such expectations. The young
intellectual life of England was slowly becoming Protestant.
&ldquo;This was especially the case among the young ladies of the
upper classes, who were becoming students learned in Latin,
Greek and Italian, and at the same time devout Protestants,
with a distinct leaning to what afterwards became Puritanism.&rdquo;
The common people had been showing their hatred
of Roman Catholicism, and &ldquo;images and religious persons
were treated disrespectfully.&rdquo; It was observed that Elizabeth
&ldquo;was very much wedded to the people and thinks as
they do,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;her attitude was much more gracious to
the common people than to others.&rdquo; The burning of Protestants,
and especially the execution of Cranmer, had stirred
the indignation of the populace of London and the south
countries against Romanism, and the feelings were spreading
throughout the country.</p>
<p>The accession of Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII
and Anne Boleyn, to the throne, gave new life to the Reformation.
As soon as it was known beyond the sea, most
of the exiles returned home, and those who had hid themselves
in the houses of their friends began to appear; but
the public religious service continued for a time the same
as Mary left it&mdash;the popish priests still celebrated mass and
kept their livings. None of the Protestant clergy who had
been ejected in the last reign were restored; and orders were
given against all innovations without public authority. The
only thing Elizabeth did before the meeting of Parliament
was to prevent pulpit disputes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was crowned on January 15, 1559. The
bishops swore fealty to the new queen, but took no part in
the coronation of &ldquo;one so plainly a heretic.&rdquo; Her first
Parliament passed a new act of supremacy in which the
queen was declared to be &ldquo;the only supreme governor of this
realm, as well in spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes
as temporal.&rdquo; While not proclaimed as &ldquo;Supreme Head of
the Church,&rdquo; all the drastic powers claimed by Henry VIII
were given to her. It may even be said that the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction bestowed upon her was more extensive
than that given to her father, for <i>schisms</i> were added to the
list of matters subject to the queen&rsquo;s correction, and she
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
was empowered to delegate her authority to commissioners,
thus enabling her to exercise her supreme governorship in a
way to be felt in every corner of the land.</p>
<p>The same Parliament passed the &ldquo;Act of Uniformity,&rdquo;
which threatened all non-conformists with fines and imprisonment,
and their ministers with deposition and banishment.
When the provisions of the act began to be enforced,
a number of the non-conformist ministers who demanded a
greater purity of the church (hence the name Puritan), a
simple, spiritual form of worship, a strict church discipline,
and a Presbyterian form of government, organized separate
congregations in connection with presbyteries, &ldquo;and a considerable
portion of the clergy and laity of the Established
Church sympathized with them. The rupture was widened
in 1592 by an act of Parliament that all who obstinately
refused to attend public worship, or led others to do so,
should be imprisoned and submit, or after three months be
banished, and again in 1595 when the Presbyterians applied
the Mosaic Sabbath laws to the Lord&rsquo;s day, and when Calvin&rsquo;s
doctrines of predestination excited animated disputes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our study of the Reformation we have found that the
pretentions of Roman Catholic infallibility were replaced by
a not less uncompromising and intolerant dogmatism, availing
itself, like the other, of the secular power, and arrogating
to itself, like the other, the assistance of the Spirit of God.
The mischief from this early abandonment of the right of
free inquiry is as evident as its inconsistency with the principles
upon which the reformers had acted for themselves.</p>
<p>Hence under the Protestant banner there arose sectarian
churches, professing to take the Bible alone as their rule of
faith and practice, when assailing the claims of Rome, and
yet binding by creeds, unknown to the Bible, all embraced
within their folds; till Protestantism becomes as creed-bound
as Romanism. Taking into view the larger results
of this inconsistency, they bring under notice the Lutheran
Church, the State churches of England and Scotland, as well
as non-conformist churches which have arisen from them.</p>
<p>Bible interpretation by the dogmatic and mystic methods
even before the death of Luther, but more intensely afterward,
made the Lutheran churches a very Babeldom. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
came &ldquo;Forms of Concord,&rdquo; made obligatory, each one resulting
in further discord. Lutherans acknowledge the
head of the State as the supreme visible ruler of the Church.
The supreme direction of ecclesiastical affairs is vested in
the councils or boards, generally appointed by the sovereign
termed &ldquo;consistories,&rdquo; consisting of both laymen and ministers.
The Lutheran established churches are so interwoven
with the State as to be usually dependent on it. They
are almost destitute of discipline, and, in some places, exclude
dissent. Dr. Schaff says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The congregations remained almost as passive as the
Roman Church. They have, in Europe, not even the right of
electing their pastor. They are exclusively ruled by their
ministers, as they are ruled by the provincial consistories, always
presided over by a layman, the provincial consistory by
a central consistory, and this again by the minister of worship
and public instruction, who is the immediate organ of the
ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to this infant baptism and infant membership, and
then you have the world in the Church, and a state of things,
if not so bad as that of Rome, yet as completely unlike the
apostolic churches, and as wide a departure from what must
result from surrender to the Bible alone and submission to
Christ and his apostles as it were possible to reach.</p>
<p>The Reformation in England was fraught with immense
blessings to the world at large, the advantage of which the
English people now enjoy. But in England&rsquo;s so-called
Protestant Church there is no trace of the three fundamental
principles enunciated by the reformers:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt>(1) The Bible the only rule of faith and practice.</dt>
<dt>(2) The duty of every man to judge the Bible for himself.</dt>
<dt>(3) The priesthood of every member of the Church.</dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;the Bible only as the rule of faith and practice,&rdquo;
they have creeds and Parliamentary control of church
services; in place of &ldquo;the duty of every man to interpret the
Bible for himself,&rdquo; this same State Church has burned and
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
hung Roman Catholics and Dissenters, the one for holding
too much Romanism, and the other for not holding as much
as the king and the clergy were pleased to demand. Then,
in lieu of &ldquo;the priesthood of every member,&rdquo; there is a
limited priesthood, differing but little from that of Rome;
with infant baptism, infant membership, and numerous other
human inventions &ldquo;making void the commandments of God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h3 id="c53">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE REFORMATION IN SCOTLAND</span></h3>
<p>Had I the time and space I would be glad to give a history
of the Reformation in Scotland under John Knox and others.
After all the prolonged suffering and conflict, it has precious
little more of Protestantism than is common in the English
State Church. There we also find the reigning monarch
represented in the General Assembly by a nobleman, as Lord
High Commissioner, who, on some occasions, has taken upon
himself to dissolve the Assembly without the consent of its
members. In 1843 a conflict between the ecclesiastical and
civil courts brought about a great disruption, giving rise to
the Free Church of Scotland, so that there is also the &ldquo;General
Assembly of the Free Church.&rdquo; But these two General
Assemblies are not on equal footing&mdash;in the very nature of
the case could not be. In the one, the proceedings of the
Assembly carry with them the sanction of the law, backed by
the civil power; while those of the other have no such sanction,
and are only binding upon willing adherents, who, by
tacit agreement, are under moral obligation. The one is a
corporate body in the eye of the law; the other entirely
voluntary. But both bodies hold that the acts of their respective
assemblies are binding upon their churches. Consequently
those churches are in subjection to a rule of which
the apostolic churches knew nothing, and, therefore, are not
in faith and practice in subjection to the Bible alone. The
&ldquo;Confession of Faith&rdquo; is the standard of appeal. Infant
baptism, infant membership, and numerous other departures
from apostolic Christianity stand out to refute any claims
that these churches of Scotland might put in. They may
protest against Rome or Episcopacy, but what matters that,
as the Bible protests all of them?</p>
<h4 id="c54">THE INDEPENDENTS</h4>
<p>But it is not to be supposed, even though the multitudes
settled down in violation of their professed principles, that
all would refrain from a fuller application of them. Hence
the multiplication of distinct parties, each claiming to be the
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
church, or a nearer approach to the church as ordained by
Christ. Coming out in this way from the English State
Church we find the Independents, who sacrificed property,
liberty and life. They were glad to escape to Holland or to
this country. Others suffered on and aided largely to win
against a persecuting State Church the liberties the people
now enjoy. Belknap&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Robinson&rdquo; gives the following
principles as underlying their church organization:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt>(1) That no church ought to consist of more members than can meet in one place for worship and discipline.</dt>
<dt>(2) That a church of Christ is to consist only of such as appear to believe in and obey him.</dt>
<dt>(3) That any competent number of such have a right, when conscience obliges them, to form themselves into a distinct church.</dt>
<dt>(4) That, being thus incorporated, they have a right to choose their own officers.</dt>
<dt>(5) That these officers are teaching elders, ruling elders, and deacons.</dt>
<dt>(6) That elders being chosen and ordained have no power to rule the church, but by consent of the brethren.</dt>
<dt>(7) That all elders and all churches are equal in respect to power and privileges.</dt>
<dt>(8) That the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is to be received sitting at the table. (When in Holland they observed it every Lord&rsquo;s day.)</dt>
<dt>(9) That ecclesiastical censures are wholly spiritual, and not to be accompanied with temporal penalties.</dt></dl>
<p>They admitted no holy days but the &ldquo;Christian Sabbath,&rdquo;
though they had occasional days of fasting and thanksgiving;
and finally they had renounced all human inventions or impositions
on religious matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Scotland we find Congregational principles as far
back as the Commonwealth. Independency had obtained
much hold in England among all classes. The soldiers of
Cromwell carried their principles with them, and are said
to have formed a Congregational church in Edinburgh. But
that church was not permanent, and we find nothing of
churches of like order in Scotland till 1726, when John Glass,
an eloquent and able minister, with avowed convictions in
harmony with those of the English Independents, withdrew
from the Church of Scotland and formed churches in most
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
of the large towns of Scotland. These churches were called
&ldquo;Glassite.&rdquo; Mr. Glass and his adherents taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt>(1) That national establishments of religion are unlawful and inconsistent with the true nature of the Church of Christ. That the church being spiritual, ought to consist only of true spiritual men.</dt>
<dt>(2) That a congregation of Jesus Christ, with its elders, is in its discipline subject to no jurisdiction under heaven, save that of Christ and his apostles.</dt>
<dt>(3) That each church should have a plurality of elders or bishops, chosen by the church, according to instruction given to Timothy and Titus, without regard to previous education for the office, continuous engagement in secular employment being no disqualification.</dt>
<dt>(4) That the churches observe the Lord&rsquo;s Supper on the first day of every week; and that love feasts be held, after the example of the primitive Christians.</dt>
<dt>(5) That mutual exhortations be practiced on the Lord&rsquo;s day, any member able to edify being at liberty to address the church.</dt>
<dt>(6) That a weekly collection be made in connection with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in aid of the poor, and for necessary expenses.</dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Glass was largely eclipsed by Robert Sandeman,
whose activity wielded a wide influence. Those who adhered
to his teachings were called &ldquo;Sandemanians.&rdquo; Sandeman
prominently repudiated that mischievous mysticism
which views &ldquo;saving faith&rdquo; as an inspiration directly from
the Holy Spirit. His teaching has been thus summarized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is needful,&rdquo; which he called the sole requisite
to justification, or acceptance with God. By the sole requisite
to justification, he understood the work finished by Christ in his
death, proved by his resurrection to be all sufficient to justify
the guilty; that the whole benefit of this is conveyed to men
only by the apostolic report concerning it; that every one who
understands this report to be true, or is persuaded that the
events actually happened, as testified by the apostles, is justified,
and finds relief to his guilty conscience; that he is relieved
not by finding any favorable symptom about his heart, but by
finding their report to be true; that the event itself, which is
reported, becomes his relief so soon as it stands true in his
mind, and accordingly becomes his faith; that all the divine
power which operates in the minds of men, either to give the
first relief to their consciences, or to influence them in every
part of their obedience to the Gospel, is persuasive power, or the
forcible conviction of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>From this we see that he saw with some degree of clearness
the nature of faith, but not that the divine economy
provides that faith shall be perfected by surrender to an
ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s own appointment. On some other
points in regard to faith he was more or less confused. He
advocated the weekly observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; love
feasts; weekly contribution for the poor; mutual exhortation
of members; plurality of elders; conditional community of
goods; and approved of theaters and public and private
diversions, when not connected with circumstances really
sinful. His influence extended to the north of Ireland, but
the people there did not adopt all his views. They attended
weekly to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, contributions, etc., but were
opposed to going to theaters or such places of amusement;
to the doctrine of the community of goods; feet washing,
etc., as advocated by Sandeman. Sandeman&rsquo;s influence extended
also to England and to this country.</p>
<h4 id="c55">HALDANE AND AIKMAN</h4>
<p>At the close of the eighteenth century spiritual religion
in Scotland was at a very low ebb. Then village preaching
and extensive itineraries were entered upon by James
A. Haldane and John Aikman. They were members of the
Established Church of Scotland. They took in hand preaching
tours unauthorized by the clergy. They were &ldquo;laymen,&rdquo;
and preaching by such men was then a strange thing in
Scotland. Their labors were so far successful that a revival
of spiritual life set in at many places and a spirit of inquiry
was aroused. They made successive tours throughout all
Scotland, as far as the Orkney Islands. Then Robert
Haldane turned his attention to the spiritual needs of his
native land, and determined to devote his large fortune to
spreading the Gospel through its benighted districts. This
led to the formation of a society for the dissemination of
religious knowledge, and to the employment of young men
of known piety to plant and superintend evening schools
for the instruction of the young in religious truths. This
movement grew to considerable proportions. But it met
with determined opposition, both from Presbyterian Dissenters
and the Established clergy. The decrees were fulminated
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
by entire bodies, as the Relief Synod, obviously leveled
against the devout and ardent itinerants. In like spirit the
Antiburger Synod decreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That as lay preaching has no warrant in the Word of
God, and as the Synod has always considered it their duty to
testify against promiscuous communion, no person under the
inspection of the Synod can, consistently with these principles,
attend upon or give countenance to public preaching by any
who are not of our community; and if any do so they ought to
be dealt with by the judicatories of the Church, to bring them
to a sense of their offensive conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going beyond this, the General Assembly of 1799 accused
the itinerant preachers of &ldquo;being artful and designing
men, disaffected to the evil constitution of the country, holding
secret meetings, and abusing the name of liberty as a
cover for a secret democracy and anarchy.&rdquo; In the midst
of this opposition a church was formed of some fourteen
persons in a private house on George Street, Edinburgh,
which was the beginning of the Tabernacle Church Leith
Walk, in which James Haldane eventually became minister,
in which capacity he exercised, without any emolument, all
the public and private duties with unbroken fidelity and zeal
for a period of fifty years. For some time this church was
content with monthly communion, but in 1802 it resolved to
spread the Lord&rsquo;s table on the first day of every week. By
the close of 1807 some eighty-five Independent churches
had been established. Out of this movement a further advance
took place, and thence arose Baptist churches in Scotland.</p>
<h4 id="c56">THE SCOTCH BAPTISTS</h4>
<p>Churches holding the immersion of believers as the only
authorized baptism have, possibly, stood out against the
apostasy (not as Baptists), even from the days of the apostles,
though frequently driven into hiding places by the force
of persecution and for the preservation of their faith and
order and also of their lives.</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the Baptists in England I shall
not dwell; though their early history is very interesting, and
far more in accord with the apostolic style than the present-day
Baptists. Passing at once to Scotland, I find no trace
of Baptist churches till the latter part of the eighteenth century,
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
excepting one of short duration formed by soldiers of
Cromwell&rsquo;s army. The earliest Scotch Baptist Church is
said to have been formed in Edinburgh in 1765 under the
efforts of Robert Carmichael, who had been a minister in
the Antiburger Church at Coupar-Augus; but later became
minister of an Independent Church (&ldquo;Glassite&rdquo;) in Edinburgh,
of which Archibald McLean was a member. Early
in life a strong impression had been made on the mind of
McLean by the preaching of George Whitfield. In 1762
he withdrew from the Established Church of Scotland and
united with this Independent Church. But it was not long
till some trouble arose over a case of discipline which resulted
in the withdrawal of both Carmichael and McLean
from the church. While thus standing aloof from church
membership they directed their attention to baptism. McLean,
not having read a line upon the subject, went carefully
through the whole of the New Testament with the inquiry
before him, &ldquo;What is baptism?&rdquo; This led him to the firm
conviction that only those capable of believing in Christ are
its subjects and that it must be performed by immersion of
the whole body in water. A year later Carmichael reached
the same conclusion. He then went to London where he
was immersed by Dr. Gill at Barbican, October 9, 1765.
On returning to Edinburgh, he baptized McLean and six
others, and formed a Baptist church. In 1769, Carmichael
moved to Dundee, and McLean became minister of the
newly-formed church. Other churches of immersed believers
were soon planted in Glasgow, Dundee, Montrose
and other places, and the sentiment in favor of returning
to the scriptural act of baptizing grew among the people.
The marked piety and noble disinterestedness of Archibald
McLean stand out as worthy of all admiration. His labors
were immense and given gratuitous, as he persisted in continuing
in employment as overseer of a printing establishment.</p>
<p>As Scotch Baptist churches multiplied there arose a disturbing
element. McLean and others held the necessity of
an ordained elders to the proper observance of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper; consequently, notwithstanding that they taught the
importance of observing the Lord&rsquo;s Supper on the first day
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
of every week, it had to be omitted when an ordained elder
could not be present. But ere long others among them saw
more light and insisted that elders were not essential to the
being of a church, that the church existed before its eldership,
and that where the church is the Lord&rsquo;s table should
be spread on the first day of every week, irrespective of the
presence of an ordained elder. This led to contention, and,
indeed, to separation. But truth will not down. We may
go with it any distance we please, but when we say, &ldquo;Thus
far and no farther,&rdquo; truth struggles to remove the hindrances
thrown across its path, and in the end starts on afresh to
complete the journey.</p>
<p>As leaven will permeate so truth must influence more
or less the mass into which it is cast. From Scotland the
principles associated with the names of the Haldanes, Carmichael
and McLean found receptive hearts in Wales. Even
in Ireland, also, there was in men&rsquo;s minds the struggling of
truth and error, the partial expulsion of the false by the
true, the consequent advance to apostolic faith and order, and
falling short of a complete return thereto, notwithstanding
progress calling for thankful recognition.</p>
<h4 id="c57">THE SEPARATISTS</h4>
<p>About the year 1802 there were a few persons in Dublin,
most of them connected with the religious establishments
of the country. The most noted among them were John
Walker, G. Carr and Dr. Darby, all of whom organized religious
bodies, differing in minor points from one another.
Their attention was directed to Christian fellowship, as they
perceived it to have existed among the disciples in apostolic
times. They concluded from the study of the New Testament
that all the first Christians in any place were connected
together in the closest brotherhood; and that as their connection
was grounded on the one apostolic gospel which they
believed, so it was altogether regulated by the precepts delivered
to them by the apostles, as the divinely commissioned
ambassadors of Christ. They were convinced that every
departure of professing Christians from this course must
have originated in a withdrawing of their allegiance from the
King of Zion, and in the turning away from the instruction
of the inspired apostles; that the authority of their word,
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
being divine, was unchangeable, and that it can not have been
annulled by or weakened by the lapse of ages, by the varying
customs of different nations, or by the enactments of
earthly legislators.</p>
<p>With such views in their minds they set out in the attempt
to return fully to the course marked out in the Scriptures;
persuaded that they were not called to make any laws
or regulations for their union, but simply to learn and adhere
to the law recorded in the divine Word. Their number soon
increased; and for some time they did not see that the union
which they maintained with each other, on the principles of
scripture, was at all inconsistent with the continuance of
their connection with the various religious bodies round
them. But after a time they were convinced that these two
things were utterly incompatible; and that the same divine
rule which regulated their fellowship with each other forbade
them to maintain any religious fellowship with others.
From this view, and the practice consequent upon it, they
were called &ldquo;Separatists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They held that even two or three disciples in any one
place, united together in the faith of the apostolic gospel,
and in obedience to the apostolic precepts, constitute the
Church of Christ in that place.</p>
<p>They held that the only good and sure hope toward God
for any sinner is by the belief of this testimony concerning
the great things of God and his salvation. And as they
understood by faith, with which justification and eternal
life were connected, nothing else but belief of the things
declared to all alike in the Scriptures, so by repentance
they understood nothing else but the new mind which that
belief produces. Everything called repentance, but antecedent
to the belief of the Word of God, or unconnected
with it, they considered spurious and evil.</p>
<p>They considered the idea of any successors to the apostles
or of any change of Christ&rsquo;s laws as utterly unchristian,
and did not tolerate any men of the clerical type among
them. They believed that the Scriptures taught the community
of goods. They held that there is no sanction in the
New Testament for the observance of the first day of the
week as the Sabbath; and that the Jewish Sabbath was one
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
of the shadows of good things to come, which passed away
on the completion of the work of Jesus on the cross. They
believed themselves bound to meet together on the first day
of the week, the memorial day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, to
show his death, in partaking of bread and wine, as the symbols
of his body and his blood shed for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>In their assembly they joined together in the various
exercises of praise and prayer, reading the Scriptures, exhorting
and admonishing one another as brethren according
to their several gifts and ability; contributed of their means
and saluted each other with &ldquo;an holy kiss.&rdquo; In the same
assemblies they attended, as occasion required, to the discipline
appointed by the apostles, for removing any evil that
might appear in the body.</p>
<p>When any brethren appeared among them possessing all
the qualifications of the office of elders or overseers, which
are marked in the apostolic writings, they thought themselves
called upon to acknowledge them as brethren in that
office, as the gifts of the Lord to his church. They held
themselves bound to live as peaceable and quiet subjects of
any government under which the providence of God placed
them; to implicitly obey all human ordinances which did not
interfere with their subjection to their heavenly King.</p>
<p>The baptism of believers was cast aside as anti-Christian,
except in the case of the heathen, who on conversion had
made no previous confession of faith. Their mistake lay
in the belief that baptism was intended to mark the mere
profession of Christian faith. They failed to see that it was
commanded by the Lord himself to follow upon a real believing
with the heart, and a confession with the mouth.
Any act called baptism prior to that is not the ordinance of
Christ, and stands for nothing. The time for baptism is so
soon as that believing confession and heart trust exists as a
fact. So long as it remains unperformed after that there
is a cessation in that particular of compliance with the divine
command, which should be terminated by obedience so soon
as possible.</p>
<p>While these people were scriptural in a number of things,
in others they fell far short of returning to apostolic Christianity.
So we must continue our search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>As we have already seen, there was a great struggle in
Europe to escape from the direful effects of departure from
apostolic simplicity. These efforts brought forth many sects,
and each sect fought desperately to secure the Bible within
its own party by the spiritual fetters of partisan interpretation.
The clergy of each denomination, arrogating to themselves
the claim of being its divinely-authorized expounders,
caused it to speak only in the interest of their sect, and thus
the Bible was made to speak in defense of each particular
creed. Detached sentences, relating to matters wholly distinct
and irrelevant, were placed in imposing array in support
of positions assumed by human leaders; the people, on
the other hand, seemed to have quietly surrendered into the
hands of the clergy all power of discrimination and all independence
in religious matters. It seemed vain that the
Bible had been put into the hands of the people in their
mother tongue, since the &ldquo;clergy&rdquo; had succeeded in imposing
upon it a seal which the &ldquo;laity&rdquo; dared not break, so that while
Protestants were delighted that they were in possession of
the Bible, it was, in fact, little else than an empty boast, so
long as they could be persuaded that they were wholly unable
to understand it.</p>
<p>The Bible thus trammeled had, nevertheless, set free
from spiritual bondage individuals here and there, who were
more or less successful in their pleadings for reform. But
among them all, however, there was no one who took hold
of the leading errors with sufficient clearness and grasp as
to liberate it from the thraldom of human tradition and restore
the Gospel to the people in its primitive simplicity and
power.</p>

<h2>PART IV
<br />The Restoration Movement in America</h2>
<h3 id="c58">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="h3line2">SPIRITUAL UNREST IN MANY PLACES</span></h3>
<p>The close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the
nineteenth century were characterized by efforts to get entirely
on apostolic ground, originating almost simultaneously
in widely-separated localities and amidst different and antagonistic
sects. But, as the greatest of these efforts developed
in our own country, we now turn our attention to
them.</p>
<p>One of these originated among the Methodists at the time
of the establishment of the American colonies, and the subject
of church government became a matter of discussion
among them. Thomas Coke, Francis Asbury and others
labored to establish prelacy, regarding themselves as superintendents
or bishops. Against this movement, James
O&rsquo;Kelley, of North Carolina, and some others of that State
and of Virginia, with a number of members, pleaded for a
congregational system, and that the New Testament be the
only creed and discipline. Those contending for the episcopal
form of government were largely in the majority, and
the reformers were unable to accomplish their wishes. Led
by James O&rsquo;Kelley, they finally seceded at Mankintown, N.
C., Dec. 25, 1793. McTiere says: &ldquo;The spirit of division
prevailed chiefly in the southern part of Virginia, and in the
border counties of North Carolina, in all of which region
the personal influence of O&rsquo;Kelley has been seen. It extended
also beyond these limits. We find the first two missionaries
in Kentucky&mdash;Ogden and Haw&mdash;drawn away into
his scheme. And in other places he had adherents&rdquo; (History
of Methodism, page 411). At first they took the name &ldquo;Republican
Methodists,&rdquo; but in 1801 &ldquo;resolved to be known as
Christians only, to acknowledge no head over the Church but
Christ, and to have no creed or discipline but the Bible.&rdquo; In
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
respect to increase of numbers, this movement was not great,
and in the course of time was weakened by changes and removals,
but its principles spread into other States.</p>
<p>About the same time Abner Jones, a physician, of Hartland,
Vt., then a member of the Baptist Church, became
&ldquo;greatly dissatisfied with sectarian names and creeds, began
to preach that all these should be abolished, and that true
piety should be made the ground of Christian fellowship.
In September, 1800, he succeeded by persevering zeal in establishing
a church of twenty-five members at Lyndon, Vt.,
and subsequently one in Bradford and one in Piermont,
N. H., in March, 1803.&rdquo; Elias Smith, a Baptist preacher,
who was about this time laboring with much success in Plymouth,
N. H., adopted Jones&rsquo; view and carried the whole
congregation with him. Several other preachers, both from
the Regular and Freewill Baptists, soon followed, and with
many other zealous preachers, who were raised up in the
newly-organized churches, traveled extensively over the New
England states, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and into
Canada, and made many converts. Those in this movement
also called themselves Christians only, and adopted the Bible
as their only rule of faith and practice.</p>
<p>Dr. Chester Bullard was the pioneer in the cause of primitive
Christianity in all Southwest Virginia. He separated
himself from the Methodist Church and most earnestly desired
to be immersed, but would not receive it at the hands
of the Baptists, as he was not sufficiently in harmony with
their tenets to unite with them. About this time Landon
Duncan, the assessor of the county, happened to call in the
discharge of his official duties. Engaging in a religious conversation
with him, Dr. Bullard freely expressed to him his
feelings and his desires, and though he freely expressed his
dissent from some of the views held by Duncan, the latter
agreed to baptize him.</p>
<p>In early life Duncan had united with the Baptists and was
ordained by them, but after a time adopted the views of the
&ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; chiefly through the teaching of Joseph Thomas,
who was in some respects a remarkable man. He was born
in North Carolina, whence he removed with his father to
Giles County, Virginia, where he became deeply imbued with
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
religious fervor, and began while quite a young man to urge
his neighbors to the importance of devoting themselves to
the service of God. Associating with O&rsquo;Kelley in North
Carolina, he desired to be immersed, when O&rsquo;Kelley persuaded
him that pouring was more scriptural, to which he
submitted after stipulating that a tubful of water should be
poured upon him. But afterward he became fully convinced
that immersion alone is baptism, and was immersed by Elder
Plumer. This brought him into intimate association with
Abner Jones, Elias Smith and others of the &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo;
He now devoted his life wholly to preaching and became
noted for the extent of his travels throughout the United
States. He traveled on foot dressed in a long, white robe,
hence he was called the &ldquo;White Pilgrim,&rdquo; and frequently, in
imitation of the Master, retired to lonely places for fasting
and prayer. He made a strong impression on the people, and
finally died of smallpox amidst his itinerant labors in New
Jersey.</p>
<p>Dr. Bullard, after his baptism by Duncan, at once began
preaching, delivering his first discourse the evening following
his baptism. Avoiding those speculation points with which
Duncan and those associated with him were so much occupied,
he presented simple views of the Gospel and the freeness
of the salvation through Christ, and showed that faith
comes by hearing the Word of God, and that &ldquo;he that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; It was a considerable
time, however, before he convinced enough people of the
scripturalness of the doctrine to form a church. By degrees,
most of those associated with Duncan were convinced by Dr.
Bullard, and through the assistance of James Redpath and
others joining him in the ministry of the Word, a number
of churches were established in that part of Virginia. About
1839 Dr. Bullard incidentally came into possession of a copy
of Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Extra on Remission of Sins.&rdquo; On
reading it he was so surprised and delighted with the new
views therein set forth that he obtained all the numbers of
the Christian Baptist and Millennial Harbinger, and was
filled with great joy to find how clear and consistent were
Campbell&rsquo;s views, and how different from the slanderous
misrepresentations which had been so persistently circulated
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
through the press and from the pulpit. He immediately
began to circulate Campbell&rsquo;s writings, preaching with great
success the ancient Gospel, and overjoyed in finding himself
unexpectedly associated with so many fellow laborers
in the effort to restore primitive Christianity. He endured
hardships as a good soldier of Jesus Christ and pushed forward
against great odds. He traveled all over Virginia,
from the mountains to the seashore, and baptized thousands.
In his prime he was one of the most powerful exhorters
that could be found, and his sermons were exceedingly clear,
scriptural and persuasive.</p>
<p>On a notable occasion the Methodists, who had become
greatly stirred by Dr. Bullard&rsquo;s preaching, chose one of their
preachers, T. J. Stone, to represent them in a debate with
Dr. Bullard on the &ldquo;Act of Baptism.&rdquo; The debate was to
be held in a grove at a place some distance from Dr. Bullard&rsquo;s
home, and he had to start the day before in order to reach
the place in time. Late in the afternoon of the first day&rsquo;s
journey he fell in with the preacher who was to be his
opponent in the debate. Stone had been studying the
Campbell and Rice Debate in search of arguments to sustain
his side of the question. As they rode along together
their conversation turned on the debate, and Dr. Bullard
noticed rather a lack of confidence in the language of his
opponent. The doctor turned the conversation so that he
might learn the cause of this, and soon reached the conclusion
that his opponent had little relish for the debate, and, in
short, in his research his confidence in affusion had been
overturned. Dr. Bullard finally said: &ldquo;You had better let
me baptize you to-morrow instead of debating.&rdquo; Stone
replied: &ldquo;If it were not for two or three things in the
way, I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night they spent at Stone&rsquo;s home, and the doctor
soon perceived that one of the greatest things in the way
was Stone&rsquo;s wife. Accordingly he gave her much attention,
and the three searched the Scriptures the greater part of
the night. A large crowd assembled the next day to hear
the discussion. Dr. Bullard announced that there would
be no debate, but that he would preach that morning and
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
Stone in the afternoon; also that there would be an immersion
immediately after the morning discourse. Much
to the surprise of all, both Mr. and Mrs. Stone presented
themselves for baptism when the invitation was given.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h3 id="c59">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="h3line2">BARTON W. STONE</span></h3>
<p>We have already learned that efforts were being made
to return to apostolic Christianity in different places in the
East, and I mentioned these efforts first because as emigration
is most usually westward, the influences thus exerted
spread far and wide. This is one of the reasons why the
plea to return to the original practice of the apostolic
churches has been more effective in the West than in the
East.</p>
<p>I now give attention to a great movement that was inaugurated
in what was then called the &ldquo;West,&rdquo; through
the untiring labors of Barton W. Stone and others. Stone
was born in Maryland, December 24, 1772. His father
died and the mother, being left with a large family of children,
moved to Pittsylvania County, Va., in 1779, where the
manners and customs of the people were very simple, and
contentment seemed to be the lot of all, and happiness dwelt
in every breast amidst the abundance of home stores, acquired
by honest industry. His first teacher was a tyrant, who
seemed to take pleasure in whipping and abusing his pupils
for every trifling offense. When called upon to recite, he
was so affected with fear, and so confused in mind, that he
could say nothing, and remained in that school only a few
days. He was then sent to another teacher, who was patient
and kind, and he advanced so rapidly that after five years&rsquo;
training his teacher &ldquo;pronounced him a finished scholar.&rdquo;
This fired him with ambition and spurred his efforts to rise
to eminence in learning.</p>
<h4 id="c60">CONFRONTED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES</h4>
<p>About this time some Baptist preachers came into the
neighborhood and began preaching to the people, and great
excitement followed. Multitudes attended their ministrations,
and many were immersed. Immersion was so novel
that people traveled long distances to see the ordinance administered.
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
Young Stone was constant in his attendance,
and was particularly interested in hearing the converts relate
their experiences. Of their conviction and great distress
they were very particular in giving an account, and how and
when they obtained deliverance from their burdens. Some
were delivered by a dream, a vision, or some uncommon
appearance of light; others by a voice spoken to them&mdash;&ldquo;Thy
sins are forgiven thee&rdquo;; and others by seeing the Savior
with their natural eyes. Such experiences were considered
good by the Church, and those relating such were baptized
and received into full fellowship. The preachers had an art
of affecting their hearers by a tuneful voice in preaching.
Not knowing any better, he considered all this a work of
God, and the way of salvation.</p>
<p>After these came Methodist preachers who were bitterly
opposed by the Baptists and Episcopalians, who publicly
declared them to be the locusts of Revelation, and warned
the people against receiving them. Stone&rsquo;s mind was much
agitated, and vacillated between the two parties. For some
time he had been in the habit of retiring in secret, morning
and evening, for prayer, with an earnest desire for religion;
but being ignorant of what he ought to do, he became discouraged
and quit praying, and turned away from religion.</p>
<p>When he was about sixteen he came into possession of
his portion of his father&rsquo;s estate. This absorbed his mind
day and night endeavoring to devise some plan as to how
to use it to the best advantage. At last he decided to acquire
a liberal education, and thus qualify himself for the practice
of law. Having reached this decision he began immediately
to arrange his affairs to put his purpose into execution.
Accordingly he bade farewell to his mother, and made his
way to the noted academy at Guilford, N. C. Here he
applied himself with great diligence to acquire an education
or die in the attempt. He divested himself of every
hindrance for the course. With such application he made
rapid progress.</p>
<p>Just before he entered the academy the students had been
greatly stirred by James McGready, a Presbyterian preacher,
and Stone was not a little surprised to find many of the students
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
assembled every morning in a private room before the
hour for recitation to engage in singing and prayer. This
was a source of uneasiness to him, and frequently brought
him to serious reflections. He labored diligently to banish
these serious thoughts, thinking that religion would impede
his progress in learning, thwart the object he had in view,
and expose him to the ridicule of his relatives and companions.
He therefore associated with those students who
made light of such things, and joined them in the ridicule
of the pious. For this his conscience severely condemned
him when alone and made him so very unhappy that he
could neither enjoy the company of the pious nor that of the
impious. This caused him to decide to go to Hampden-Sidney
College, Virginia, that he might be away from the
constant sight of religion. He determined to leave at once,
but was prevented by a violent storm. He remained in his
room all day and reached the decision to pursue his studies
there and to attend to his own business, and let others do the
same.</p>
<p>Having made this resolution, he was settled till his roommate
asked him to accompany him to hear Mr. McGready
preach. Of the deep impression made on him by the discourse
he heard on that occasion he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His coarse, tremulous voice excited in me the idea of something
unearthly. His gestures were the very reverse of elegance.
Everything appeared by him forgotten but the salvation
of souls. Such earnestness, such zeal, such powerful persuasion,
enforced by the joys of heaven and miseries of hell, I had never
witnessed before. My mind was chained by him, and followed
him closely in his rounds of heaven, earth and hell, with feelings
indescribable. His concluding remarks were addressed
to the sinners to flee the wrath to come without delay. Never
before had I comparatively felt the force of truth. Such was
my excitement that had I been standing I should have probably
sunk to the floor under the impression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the meeting was over he returned to his room, and
when night came he walked out into a field and seriously
reasoned with himself on the all-important subject of religion.
He asked himself: &ldquo;What shall I do? Shall I
embrace religion, or not?&rdquo; He weighed the subject and
counted the cost. He concluded that if he embraced religion
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
he would then incur the displeasure of his relatives
and lose the favor and company of his companions: become
the object of their scorn and ridicule; relinquish all his plans
and schemes for worldly honor, wealth and preferment, and
bid adieu to all the pleasures in which he had lived. He
asked himself, &ldquo;Are you willing to make this sacrifice?&rdquo;
His heart answered, &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; Then there loomed before
him a certain alternative, &ldquo;You must be damned.&rdquo; This
thought was so terrible to him that he could not endure the
thought, and, after due deliberation, he resolved from that
hour to seek religion at the sacrifice of every earthly good,
and immediately prostrated himself before God in supplication
for mercy.</p>
<p>In accordance with the popular belief, and the experience
of the pious in those days, he anticipated a long and painful
struggle before he should be prepared to come to Christ, or,
in the language of that day, before he should &ldquo;get religion.&rdquo;
This anticipation was fully realized. For a year he was
tossed about on the waves of uncertainty, laboring, praying
and striving for &ldquo;saving faith,&rdquo; sometimes desponding and
almost despairing of ever getting it. He wrestled with this
condition until he heard a sermon on &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; which
so impressed his mind that he retired to the woods alone
with his Bible. There he read and prayed with various
feelings, between hope and fear, till the great truth of the
love of God so triumphed over him that he afterward said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I yielded and sunk at his feet, a willing subject. I loved
him, I adored him, I praised him aloud in the silent night, in
the echoing groves around. I confessed to the Lord my sin and
folly in disbelieving his word so long, and in following so long
the devices of men. I now saw that a poor sinner was as much
authorized to believe in Jesus at first as last; that now was
the accepted time and the day of salvation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that time he looked forward to preaching, and in
the spring of 1796 applied to the Presbytery of Orange,
N. C., for license to preach. In describing the proceedings
of the presbytery, he says: &ldquo;Never shall I forget the impression
made on my mind when a venerable old father addressed
the candidates, standing up together before the presbytery.
After the address he presented to each of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
candidates the Bible (not the Confession of Faith), with this
solemn charge, &lsquo;Go ye unto all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature.&rsquo;&rdquo; He was assigned to a certain
district, but soon became much discouraged, and contemplated
seeking regions where he was not known and turning his
attention to some other calling in life.</p>
<p>In the midst of much doubt and perplexity, he turned
westward and finally reached Caneridge, Bourbon County,
Ky., where he remained for a few months, then returned to
Virginia.</p>
<h4 id="c61">ORDAINED TO THE MINISTRY</h4>
<p>In the fall of 1798 he received a call from the united congregations
of Caneridge and Concord, through the Transylvania
Presbytery. He accepted, and a day was appointed
for his ordination to the ministry. Knowing that at his
ordination he would be required to adopt the Westminster
Confession of Faith, as the system of doctrine taught in the
Bible, he determined to give it a very careful examination.
This was to him almost the beginning of sorrows. He
stumbled at the doctrine of the Trinity as therein taught, and
could not conscientiously subscribe to it. Doubts, too, arose
in his mind on the doctrines of election, reprobation and
predestination, as then taught. He had before this time
learned from those higher up in the ecclesiastical world the
way of divesting those doctrines of their hard, repulsive
features, and admitted them as true, yet unfathomable mysteries.
Viewing them as such, he let them alone in his
public discourses and confined himself to the practical part of
religion, and to subjects within his depth. But in re-examining
these doctrines he found the covering put over them
could not hide them from a discerning eye with close inspection.
Indeed, he saw that they were necessary to the
system, without any covering.</p>
<p>He was in this state of mind when the day for his ordination
came. He determined to tell the presbytery honestly
his state of mind, and to request them to defer his ordination
until he should be better informed and settled. When the
day came a large congregation assembled, but before the
presbytery convened he took aside the two pillars&mdash;James
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
Blythe and Robert Marshall&mdash;and made known to them his
difficulties and that he had determined to decline ordination
at that time. They labored, but in vain, to remove his difficulties
and objections. They asked him how far he was
willing to receive the Confession of Faith. To this he replied,
&ldquo;As far as I see it is consistent with the Word of
God.&rdquo; They concluded that that was sufficient. The presbytery
then convened, and when the question, &ldquo;Do you receive
and adopt the Confession of Faith as containing the
system of doctrine taught in the Bible?&rdquo; he answered aloud,
so that the whole assembly could hear, &ldquo;I do, so far as I
see it consistent with the Word of God.&rdquo; No objection
being raised to this answer he was ordained.</p>
<p>The reception of his ordination papers neither ended his
intellectual misgivings nor his difficulties with his strictly
orthodox ministerial associates in the presbytery. His mind,
from this time until he finally broke the fetters of religious
bondage, &ldquo;was continually tossed on the waves of speculative
divinity,&rdquo; the all-engrossing theme of the religious community
at that time. Clashing, controversial theories were
urged by the different sects with much zeal and bad feeling.
At that time he believed and taught that mankind were
so depraved that they could do nothing acceptable to God
until his Spirit, by some physical, almighty and mysterious
power had quickened, enlightened and regenerated the heart,
and thus prepared the sinner to believe in Jesus for salvation.
He began to see that if God did not perform this
regenerating work in all, it was because he chose to do it
for some and not for others, and that this depended upon his
own sovereign will and pleasure. He then saw that the
doctrine was inseparably linked with unconditional election
and reprobation, as taught in the Westminster Confession of
Faith; that they are virtually one, and that was the reason
why he admitted the decrees of election and reprobation,
having admitted the doctrine of total depravity. Scores of
objections continually crossed his mind against the system.
These he imputed to blasphemous suggestions of Satan, and
labored to repel them as satanic temptations and not honestly
to meet them with Scripture arguments. Often, when addressing
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
the multitudes on the doctrine of total depravity,
on their inability to believe and on the physical power of
God to produce faith, and then persuading the helpless to
&ldquo;repent and believe&rdquo; the Gospel, his zeal would in a moment
be chilled by such questions as: &ldquo;How can they believe?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How can they repent?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can they do impossibilities?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How can they be guilty in not doing them?&rdquo; Such thoughts
almost stifled his ability to speak, and were as great weights
pressing him down to the shades of death. The pulpits were
continually ringing with this doctrine; but to his mind it
ceased to be a relief; for whatever name it was called, he
could see that the inability was in the sinner, and therefore
he could not believe nor repent, but must be damned.
Wearied with the works and doctrines of men and distrustful
of their influence, he made the Bible his constant companion.
He honestly, earnestly and prayerfully sought for
the truth, determined to buy it at the sacrifice of everything
else.</p>
<p>He was relieved from this state of perplexity by this
resolve. By reading and meditating upon the Word of
God, he became convinced that God did love the whole world,
and that the only reason why he did not save all was because
of their unbelief, and that the reason why they believed not
was because they neglected and received not his testimony
concerning his Son, for the Scripture says: &ldquo;These are
written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.&rdquo;
From this he saw that the requirement to believe in the Son
of God was reasonable, because the testimony given is sufficient
to produce faith in the sinner, and the invitation and
encouragement of the Gospel are sufficient, if believed, to
lead him to the Savior for the promised salvation and eternal
life. From that moment of new light and joy he began to
part company with Calvinism, declaring it to be the heaviest
clog on Christianity in the world, a dark mountain between
heaven and earth, shutting out the love of God from the
sinner&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>In the joy of this new-found liberty he received such
power that made him one of God&rsquo;s choicest instruments in
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
awakening religious society out of its apathy, and in preparing
the way for the great religious movement with which
the last century was ushered in. Born with his new convictions
of God&rsquo;s all-abounding love, was an intense yearning
to bring his fellow men to the joy of such a salvation. While
the fire was kindling in his soul, he heard of a great religious
excitement which had already begun in Logan County, Kentucky,
under the labors of certain Presbyterian preachers,
among whom was the same James McGready whose preaching
had so strongly affected Stone, while a youth, in North
Carolina. In the spring of 1801 he attended one of these
camp meetings, and for the first time witnessed those strange
agitations and cataleptic attacks, which baffled description.
He describes them thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scene to me was new, and passing strange. It baffled
description. Many, very very many, fell down as men slain
in battle, and continued for hours together in an apparently
breathless and motionless state; sometimes for a few moments
reviving and exhibiting symptoms of life by a deep groan or a
piercing shriek, or by a prayer for mercy most fervently uttered.
After lying thus for hours they obtained deliverance. The
gloomy cloud which had covered their faces seemed gradually
and visibly to disappear, and hope in smiles brightened into
joy; they would rise shouting deliverance, and then would address
the surrounding multitude in language truly eloquent.
(Biography of Stone, page 34.)</p>

<h4 id="c62">REMARKABLE MEETING AT CANE RIDGE</h4>
<p>Returning from these strange scenes, he entered the pulpit
at Caneridge with heart aglow with spiritual fervor. No
longer shackled by the doctrine of election and reprobation,
he took for his text the inspiring message of the great commission:
&ldquo;Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel
to the whole creation. He that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.&rdquo;
Old as was the text, it came like a new evangel to this people,
who had known nothing but the hard terms of a Calvinistic
creed. The audience was visibly affected, and he left them
promising to return in a few days. This was the beginning
of one of the greatest revivals in history. On his return a
vast multitude awaited him, and he had scarcely begun to
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
picture before them the great salvation when scores fell to
the ground as if smitten by some unseen hand. It is well to
let Mr. Stone describe the scene in his own language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some attempted to fly from the scene panic-stricken, but
they either fell or returned immediately to the crowd, as unable
to get away. In the midst of this exercise an intelligent
deist in the neighborhood stepped up to me and said, &ldquo;Mr.
Stone, I always thought before that you were an honest man,
but now I am convinced that you are deceiving the people.&rdquo;
I viewed him with pity, and mildly spoke a few words to him;
immediately he fell as a dead man, and arose no more until
he had confessed the Savior. (Biography, pages 36, 37.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report of this remarkable meeting soon spread
through the country, and shortly afterward he held a protracted
meeting at Concord. The whole country was aroused
and multitudes of all denominations attended. Party spirit
shrank away and all joined heartily in the meeting, which
continued five days and nights without a break, and great
numbers abandoned sin.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1801, Barton W. Stone was married to Miss
Elizabeth Campbell, of Muhlenberg County, Kentucky.
Soon after marriage they hurried on to Caneridge for the
memorable meeting which began on Friday before the third
Sunday in August. The news concerning the remarkable
meeting at Concord had spread far and wide, and when the
time came to begin the meeting at Caneridge the roads were
literally crowded with wagons, carriages, horsemen and footmen,
moving to the camp grounds. The crowd was estimated
at thirty thousand. During the meeting four or five preachers
were frequently speaking at the same time, in different
parts of the encampment, without confusion. All denominations
joined in the conduct of the meeting. Party spirit
for the time had disappeared, and all united in the great
work. Multitudes abandoned sin and entered the profession
and practice of religion. The meeting continued six or
seven days and nights, and would have continued longer but
food for the multitude could not be found.</p>
<p>This meeting was attended by many from Ohio and other
distant parts, who returned to their homes and spread the
same spirit in their neighborhoods, and the same results
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
followed, and it can not be denied that great good resulted.
Nor were its effects by any means transient, but were felt
for years in the rapid growth of the churches in general and
in a great degree of religious fervor.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this great excitement Mr. Stone
had been employed almost day and night in preaching, singing,
visiting, and praying with and for the distressed, till his
lungs failed and became inflamed, attended with a violent
cough, and it was believed that he had tuberculosis. His
strength failed and he believed that his end was near. Notwithstanding
this he had an intense desire to attend a camp-meeting
a few miles distant from Caneridge. His physician
had strictly forbidden him to preach any more till his disease
should be removed.</p>
<p>This meeting was held in a grove near Paris. Here for
the first time a Presbyterian preacher opposed the work and
the doctrine by which the zeal among them had its existence
and life. He labored hard to bring the people under the
yoke of Calvin and to regulate them according to his standard.
He wished to leave the camp at night and repair to the
town, nearly a mile away, and hold the meeting in a house
that would not hold half the people. This could not be done
without leaving their tent and other things exposed. The
consequence was, the meeting was divided and the work
greatly hindered. Infidels and formalists were greatly elated
over this supposed victory and passed great encomiums on
the preacher; but the hearts of the revivalists were filled
with sorrow. Stone went to the meeting in town. A
preacher was put forward who had always been hostile to
the work and seldom mingled with the revivalists. He addressed
the assembly in &ldquo;iceberg style,&rdquo; and its influence was
very depressing. Stone had decided to lead the congregation
in prayer just as soon as the preacher closed. When he
finally closed, Stone arose and said, &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo; At
that very moment another preacher of the same cast with
the former rose in the pulpit to preach another sermon; but
Stone proceeded to pray, feeling a tender concern for the
people. While he was praying the people became much
affected and the house was filled with distress. Some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
preachers jumped out of the window back of the pulpit and
fled. Stone then pushed his way through the crowd to
those in distress, pointed them to the way of salvation, and
administered to them the comforts of the Gospel. The
physician who was attending him being present, pressed his
way through the crowd and found Stone wet with perspiration.
He ordered him to his home, lecturing him severely
for violating his orders. He put on dry clothes and retired
at once, slept sounding, and arose next morning perfectly
relieved from his affliction. He soon regained his strength
and joyfully resumed his ministerial duties. This incident
brought the campmeeting to a sudden close.</p>
<h4 id="c63">&ldquo;A TIME OF DISTRESS&rdquo;</h4>
<p>There were at this time several other preachers in the
Presbyterian Church who coincided in religious views with
Stone. These were Richard McNemar, John Thompson,
John Dunlavy, Robert Marshall and David Purviance. The
three former lived in Ohio, and the three latter lived in Kentucky.
They all boldly preached the sufficiency of the Gospel
to save men, and that the testimony of God was designed and
able to produce faith, and that sinners were capable of understanding
and believing this testimony, and of acting upon it
by coming to the Savior and from him obtaining salvation
and the Holy Spirit. When they first began to preach these
things, &ldquo;the people appeared as just awakened from the sleep
of ages. They seemed to see for the first time that they
were responsible beings, and that a refusal to use the means
appointed was a damning sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This departure from the doctrine of the Westminster
Confession of Faith soon occasioned a virulent opposition
on the part of those who adhered to it. &ldquo;At first they were
pleased to see the Methodists and Baptists so cordially uniting
with us in the worship; but as soon as they saw these
sects drawing away disciples after them, they raised the
tocsin of alarm&mdash;The Confession of Faith is in danger, &lsquo;To
your tents, O Israel!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These partisans began to preach boldly the doctrines of
their Confession of Faith and used the most potent arguments
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
in their defense. &ldquo;A fire was now kindled that threatened
to ruin the great fervor among the people. It revived
the dying spirit of partyism and gave strength to trembling
infidels and lifeless professors. The sects were aroused.
The Methodists and Baptists, who had so long lived in peace
and harmony with the Presbyterians and with one another,
now girded on their armor and marched into the deathly
field of controversy and war. These were times of distress.
The spirit of partyism soon expelled the spirit of love and
union&mdash;peace fled before discord and strife and religion was
stifled and banished in the unhallowed struggle for pre-eminence.
Who shall be the greatest seemed to be the spirit
of the contest. The salvation of the world was no longer
the burden, and the spirit of mourning in prayer took its
flight from the breasts of many preachers and people. Yet
there were some of all the sects who deplored this unhappy
state of things; but their entreating voice was drowned in
the din of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Presbytery of Springfield, Ohio, arraigned McNemar
on the charge of heresy, and the case came before
the synod at Lexington, Ky. Foreseeing their fate before
that body, Stone, McNemar, Thompson, Dunlavy and Marshall
drew up a protest, declaring their independence and
withdrawal from the jurisdiction of the synod. The synod
then suspended them and declared their congregations vacant.
This act produced great commotion and division among the
churches and confirmed the seceding ministers in their opposition
to creeds and authoritative ecclesiastical systems.
But as yet they had no thought of ceasing to hold the Presbyterian
faith, and that they might continue in the service
of the Church organized themselves into an independent presbytery,
called the &ldquo;Springfield Presbytery,&rdquo; but soon finding
this position an impossible one and the whole system out of
harmony with their views, they now took another step in
their work of reform. Renouncing their allegiance to all
authority but that of their divine Master, they resolved to be
governed by the Bible as their only rule of faith and practice.
This called for the tracts and sermons from the opposition,
and the views thus canvassed became widely disseminated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Soon after his separation, Stone called the churches at
Caneridge and Concord together and informed them that he
could no longer preach to support Presbyterianism, but that
his labors should henceforth be directed to advance the kingdom
of God, irrespective of party, releasing them from all
pecuniary obligations to him. Thus for the cause of truth
he sacrificed the friendship of two large churches and an
abundant salary for his support. He preferred the truth to
the friendship and kindness of his associates in the Presbyterian
ministry, who were dear to him, and tenderly united
in the bonds of love. Having now no support from the
congregations, and having emancipated his slaves, he turned
his attention cheerfully to labor on his farm. Though
fatigued in body, his spirit was happy and calm. He did
not relax his ministerial labors, preaching almost every night
and often in the daytime to those who were anxious to hear
the Word. He had no money to hire laborers, and often
on his return home he had to labor at night while others
were asleep to redeem his lost time.</p>
<p>Co-operating with his associates in the Springfield Presbytery
in preaching and planting churches, a year had scarcely
passed until such an organization was perceived to be unscriptural,
and was by common consent renounced, all agreeing
to take the name &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; which they believed to be
the only proper title for Christ&rsquo;s followers, and believed it
to have been given by divine appointment to the disciples at
Antioch. Having divested themselves of all party creeds
and party names, and trusting alone in God and the word
of his grace, they became a byword and laughing stock to
the whole family of the sects; all of whom prophesied their
speedy annihilation. Through much tribulation and strenuous
opposition they advanced, and churches and preachers
were multiplied.</p>
<p>As their renouncing their allegiance to all authority in
religious matters but that of the Lord Jesus Christ aroused
much interest and no little opposition at the time, it will,
no doubt, be interesting to my readers to have this remarkable
production in full, together with the witnesses&rsquo; address
in full, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h4 id="c64">THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF THE SPRINGFIELD PRESBYTERY</h4>
<p>The Presbytery of Springfield, sitting at Caneridge, in
the county of Bourbon, being, through a gracious Providence,
in more than ordinary bodily health, growing in strength and
size daily; and in perfect soundness and composure of mind;
but knowing that it is appointed for all delegated bodies once
to die; and considering that the life of every such body is
very uncertain, do make and ordain this our last will and
testament, in manner and form following, viz:</p>
<p><i>Imprimis.</i> We <i>will</i>, that this body die, be dissolved,
and sink into union with the body of Christ at
large; for there is but one body and one spirit, even
as we are called in one hope of our calling.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that our name of distinction, with
its <i>Reverend title</i>, be forgotten, that there be but one
Lord over God&rsquo;s heritage, and his name one.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that our power of making laws for
the government of the Church, and executing them by
delegated authority, forever cease; that the people
may have free course to the Bible, and adopt the <i>law
of the spirit of life in Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that candidates for the gospel ministry
henceforth study the Holy Scriptures, with fervent
prayer, and obtain license from God to preach the
simple Gospel, <i>with the Holy Spirit sent down from
heaven</i>, without any mixture of philosophy, vain deceit,
traditions of men, or the rudiments of the world.
And let none take <i>this honor to himself, but he that is
called of God, as was Aaron</i>.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that the Church of Christ resume
her native right of internal government, try her candidates
for the ministry, as to their soundness in the
faith, acquaintance with experimental religion, gravity
and aptness to teach; and admit no other proof of their
authority but Christ speaking in them. We will that
the Church of Christ look up to the Lord of the harvest
to send forth laborers into the harvest; and that
she resume her primitive right of trying those <i>who
say they are apostles and are not</i>.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that each particular church as a
body, actuated by the same spirit, choose her own
preacher and support him by a free-will offering, without
a written <i>call</i> or <i>subscription</i>, admit members, remove
offenses; and never henceforth <i>delegate</i> her right
of government to any man or set of men whatever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that the people henceforth take
the Bible as the only sure guide to heaven; and as
many as are offended with other books, which stand
in competition with it, may cast them into the fire
if they choose; for it is better to enter into the life
having one book than having many to be cast into
hell.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that preachers and people cultivate
a spirit of mutual forbearance; pray more and
dispute less; and while they behold the signs of the
times, look up, and confidently expect that redemption
draweth nigh.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that our weak brethren who may
have been wishing to make the Presbytery of Springfield
their king, and wot not what is now become of it,
betake themselves to the Rock of Ages, and follow
Jesus for the future.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that the Synod of Kentucky examine
every member who may be suspected of having
departed from the Confession of Faith, and suspend
every such heretic immediately, in order that the oppressed
may go free, and taste the sweets of gospel
liberty.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> We <i>will</i>, that Ja&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, the author of
two letters lately published in Lexington, be encouraged
in his zeal to destroy <i>partyism</i>. We will, moreover,
that our past conduct be examined into by all
who may have correct information; but let foreigners
beware of speaking evil of things which they know
not.</p>
<p><i>Item.</i> Finally, we <i>will</i>, that all our <i>sister bodies</i>
read their Bibles carefully, that they may see their
fate there determined, and prepare for death before
it is too late.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Springfield Presbytery.</span></span></p>
<p>June 28, 1804. (L. S.)</p>

<span class="lr"><i>Witnesses</i>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c65">THE WITNESSES&rsquo; ADDRESS</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We, the above-named witnesses of the Last Will and
Testament of the Springfield Presbytery, knowing that there
will be many conjectures respecting the causes which have
occasioned the dissolution of that body, think proper to testify
that from its first existence it was knit together in love, lived
in peace and concord, and died a voluntary and happy death.</p>
<p>Their reasons for dissolving that body were the following:
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
With deep concern they viewed the divisions and party spirit
among professing Christians, principally owing to the adoption
of human creeds and forms of government. While they were
united under the name of a presbyter, they endeavored to
cultivate a spirit of love and unity with all Christians, but
found it extremely difficult to suppress the idea that they
themselves were a party separate from others. This difficulty
increased in proportion to their success in the ministry.
Jealousies were excited in the minds of other denominations;
and a temptation was laid before those who were connected
with the various parties to view them in the same light. At
their last meeting they undertook to prepare for the press a
piece entitled, &ldquo;Observations on Church Government,&rdquo; in which
the world will see the beautiful simplicity of Christian Church
government, stript of human invention and lordly traditions.</p>
<p>As they proceeded in the investigation of that subject,
they soon found that there was neither precept nor example
in the New Testament for such confederacies as modern church
sessions, presbyteries, synods, General Assemblies, etc. Hence
they concluded that while they continued in the connection in
which they then stood, they were off the foundation of the
apostles and prophets of which Christ himself is the chief
cornerstone. However just, therefore, their views of church
might have been, they would have gone out under the name,
the precious cause of Jesus, and dying sinners who are kept
from the Lord by the existence of sects and parties in the
church, they have cheerfully consented to retire from the din
and fury of conflicting parties&mdash;sink out of the view of fleshly
minds, and die the death. They believe their death will be
great gain to the world. But though dead, as above, and
stript of their mortal frame, which only served to keep them
too near the confines of Egyptian bondage, they yet live and
speak in the land of gospel liberty; they blow the trumpet
of jubilee, and willingly devote themselves to the help of the
Lord against the mighty. They will aid the brethren, by
their counsel, when required; assist in ordaining elders or
pastors, seek the divine blessing, unite with all Christians,
commune together, and strengthen each others&rsquo; hands in the
work of the Lord.</p>
<p>We design, by the grace of God, to continue in the exercise
of those functions which belong to us as ministers of the
Gospel, confidently trusting in the Lord, that he will be with
us. We candidly acknowledge that in some things we may err,
through human infirmity; but he will correct our wanderings
and preserve his Church. Let all Christians join with us in
crying to God day and night to remove the obstacles which
stand in the way of his work, and give him no rest till he
make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. We heartily unite
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
with our Christian brethren of every name in thanksgiving to
God for the display of his goodness in the glorious work he
is carrying on in our western country, which we hope will
terminate in the universal spread of the Gospel. (Biography
of B. W. Stone, pages 51-55.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c66">PRACTICES MODIFIED IN MANY PARTICULARS</h4>
<p>The stand they now took drove them to modify their
practices in many particulars. Among the first things to
which they turned their attention was infant baptism. Previous,
indeed, to the great excitement in 1801, Robert
Marshall had become satisfied that infant baptism was not
taught in the Word of God; upon which Stone tried to set
him right, but in the course of the discussion he became
so thoroughly convinced of its unscripturalness that he discontinued
the practice entirely. The religious awakening,
however, soon engrossed the minds of all, and for some
years baptism was left out of view. At length, many becoming
dissatisfied with their infant baptism, a meeting
was convened to thoroughly consider the subject, and, after
a friendly investigation, and discussion, it was decided that
each member should act in accordance with his convictions.
As none among them had been immersed, it was a question
whether any one was qualified to administer baptism, which
was finally settled upon the ground that authority to preach
carried with it the authority to baptize. In the performance
of this newly-discovered duty, the ministers first baptized
each other, and then their congregations. The practice
of immersion soon prevailed generally among the
churches.</p>
<p>Shortly after having reached the conclusion that the
immersion of believers is the only Scriptural baptism, at
a great meeting at Concord, when mourners were daily
invited to collect around for prayer, as was their custom
then, and many persons were prayed for without receiving
the expected comfort, the words of Peter rolled through
Stone&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&ldquo;Repent, and be baptized every one of you
in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;and he
thought, &ldquo;were Peter here he would thus address these
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
mourners.&rdquo; So he quickly arose and addressed them in
the same language and urged them to comply with this demand.
The effect, however, was the reverse of what he
intended. Instead of comforting the mourners, it only
perplexed and confused them by directing their attention to
an untried course of procedure utterly unknown to &ldquo;revivals,&rdquo;
and for which they were wholly unprepared. &ldquo;While
their hearts were filled with ardent desires for special operations
of the Holy Spirit and of fire, this unexpected presentation
produced a chilling effect, and tended to cool the
ardor of their excited imagination. Mr. Stone himself,
indeed, quoted Peter&rsquo;s language on this occasion evidently
more from his anxiety to suggest some means of relief,
and from his unbounded confidence in the Word of God,
than from any proper understanding of the relation of baptism
to remission of sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The independent stand that Stone took on the Bible
alone greatly increased his labors. Kindred spirits speedily
rallied to his support. The Presbyterians forbade their
people to associate with them in their worship, on pain of
censure or exclusion, but this caused many to cast their lot
with them. Churches quickly sprang up over a wide region,
rejecting all standards but the Bible and refusing to wear
any name but that of &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo; Stone and his co-laborers
now devoted themselves to encouraging and strengthening
these widely-scattered churches.</p>
<h4 id="c67">&ldquo;SHAKERISM&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Scarcely had the work been inaugurated, however, before
the very life of the churches was threatened by the appearance
of a strange delusion. A semi-religious, socialistic
movement, known as &ldquo;Shakerism,&rdquo; had some years before
this established several communities in the State of New
York. Its leaders, hearing of the revolt against Calvinism
led by Stone, sent three missionaries&mdash;Bates, Mitchum and
Young&mdash;among them. They were eminently qualified for
their work, and soon made sad havoc of the newly-planted
churches. Stone thus describes them and their work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their appearance was prepossessing, they were grave and
unassuming at first in their manners; very intelligent and
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
ready in the Scriptures, and of great boldness in their faith.
They informed us that they had heard of us in the East, and
greatly rejoiced in the work of God among us&mdash;that as far as
we had gone we were right, but we had not gone far enough
into the work&mdash;that they had been sent by their brethren to
teach the way of God more perfectly, by obedience to which all
should be led into perfect holiness. They seemed to understand
all the springs and avenues of the human heart. They
delivered their testimony and labored to confirm it by the
Scriptures. They promised the greatest blessings to the
obedient, but certain damnation to the disobedient. They
urged the people to confess their sins to them, especially
the sin of matrimony, and to forsake all immediately&mdash;husbands
must forsake their wives and wives their husbands....
Many said they were the great power of God,
confessed their sins to them and forsook their marriage state.
Among them were three of our preachers&mdash;Matthew Houston,
Richard McNamar and John Dunlavy. Several more of our
preachers and pupils, alarmed, fled from us, and joined the
sects around us. (Biography, page 62)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was only by the great effort of Stone that the churches
were saved from this vortex of ruin. He labored day and
night, far and near, among the churches where the Quakers
went. By this means the evil influence was checked and
their broken ranks were rallied, and soon led once more to
victory.</p>
<h4 id="c68">THE WORK PROSPERS</h4>
<p>Soon after the trouble with the Quakers had been quelled
and the churches were once more in a prosperous condition,
another trouble arose which threatened their entire overthrow.
Two of the preachers, who with Stone had thrown
off the yoke of Presbyterianism, abandoned the movement,
reaffirmed their faith in the Westminster Confession of
Faith, and returned to the Presbyterian fold. &ldquo;Of the five
of us,&rdquo; as he wrote at a later date, &ldquo;that left the Presbyterians,
I only was left, and they sought my life.&rdquo; Conscious
of the integrity of his purpose, and convinced of the
scripturalness of his position, Stone continued to preach to
the churches far and near, to any who would listen to him,
rendering his services gratuitously, and earning as best he
could the support of his family out of his little farm.
Preaching the Gospel as he now understood it, multitudes
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
flocked to his standard, and many flourishing churches were
established by him in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
<p>As an evangelist among the pioneer population of newly-settled
States he was without a rival. His large, generous
nature quickly won the confidence of the hardy inhabitants.
His zeal and originality awakened their interest
and fixed their attention. His warm sympathies and strong
emotions melted them to repentance and led them to obedience.
Seldom did he preach a sermon that did not result
in conversions, sometimes scores coming forward at the
close of a single address. At other times the wayside cabin
with its lonely occupant received with gladness the message
of life. Here is a scene as he describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day as I was riding along slowly to an appointment
at night, I was passing by a small hut, when a woman ran out
and called to me. I stopped my horse. She told that she had
heard me preach the day before, and with a heavenly countenance
thanked God for it. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Lord has
blessed my soul. Will you stop and baptize me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;gladly will I do it.&rdquo; I dismounted, and walked into the
hut. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;will you wait till I send for my sister,
a short distance off. She was with me, and the Lord has
blessed her, too. She wants also to be baptized.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I will gladly wait.&rdquo; She quickly dispatched a little
boy to call her husband from the field near the house, and to
tell the sister to come. In the meantime she was busy preparing
dinner for me. It was no doubt the best she had, but
such as I had never seen before. I never more thankfully,
more happily, and more heartily dined. The husband soon
came in, and the wife beckoned him out, and informed him of
her intention of being baptized. He obstinately opposed it.
In tears and distress she informed me. I talked mildly with
him of the impropriety of his conduct, and at length gained his
consent. Her countenance brightened with joy, and her sister
came in shortly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, in the depths of the forest, in a stream that flowed
near by, was witnessed a scene that rivals in picturesqueness
and simple beauty any recorded in the Word of God.</p>
<p>On another occasion as he was returning from an appointment
he was overtaken by a gentleman returning from
the same meeting, and the two continued the journey together.
Stone introduced the subject of religion, which
was found not to be disagreeable to the stranger, though
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
he made no profession of religion. He urged him with
many arguments to a speedy turning to the Lord. It was
very evident that his mind was deeply troubled and that he
was vacillating as to his choice of life or death. At length
they came to a clear running stream, when he said to Stone:
&ldquo;See, here is water. What doth hinder me to be baptized?&rdquo;
To which he replied in the language of Philip to the Eunuch:
&ldquo;If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.&rdquo; The
ready response came: &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the
Son of God, and am determined hereafter to be his servant.&rdquo;
Without anything further passing between them,
they dismounted and Stone baptized him.</p>
<p>About 1812 Stone filled an appointment of long standing
in Meigs County, Ohio. The Separate Baptists, by previous
appointment, held their annual association at the same
time and place. They agreed to worship together. The
crowd of people was great, and early in the meeting Stone
baptized William Caldwell, a Presbyterian preacher, in the
Ohio River. This drew the cords of friendship more closely
between him and the Baptists. By this united effort the excitement
became very great. The elders and members of
the association met daily in a house near the stand, where
they transacted their business, while worship was carried on
at the stand. Stone was asked and urged to assist them in
their deliberations in the association, and frequently requested
to give his opinion on certain points, which he did
to their acceptance and approbation. They had a very difficult
case before them, on which they could come to no decision.
He was urged to speak on it, and to speak freely.
He spoke freely and fully on the point, showing it to be
a party measure, and unscriptural, at the same time exerting
himself against sectarianism, formularies and creeds,
laboring all the while to establish the scriptural ground of
union among Christians, and the name they should wear,
and that until Christians were united in spirit on the Bible
there would be no end to such difficult cases as now confronted
them. Having closed his speech, he went at once
to the stand.</p>
<p>The mind of the association was withdrawn from any
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
further consideration of the knotty cases before them to
the consideration of what had been presented to them in
the speech which they had just heard, with the result that
they agreed to forever lay aside their formularies and creeds
and take the Bible alone for their rule of faith and practice&mdash;to
drop the name &ldquo;Baptist&rdquo; and take the name &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;&mdash;and
to disband their association and join Stone and
others in their efforts to return to apostolic Christianity.
They then marched to the stand, shouting the praises of God
and proclaiming aloud what they had done. They embraced
each other with Christian love, by which the union
was cemented. This gave a mighty impetus to the work
and multitudes were added to the Lord.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h3 id="c69">CHAPTER III.<br /><span class="sc">Thomas Campbell</span></h3>
<p>For the present I turn from the work of Stone to that
of the Campbells. Chiefly because of failing health, Thomas
Campbell, an humble, but intellectually and spiritually-gifted
minister of the Seceder Presbyterian Church in the
parish of Ahory, Armaugh County, Ireland, determined to
seek for himself and for his family a home in this country.
He came alone, intending to send for his family as soon as
he had established himself. He arrived in Philadelphia
May 27, 1807. The Seceder Synod of North America was
in session in that city when he landed. He at once presented
his credentials to that body, was cordially received,
and at once assigned to the Presbytery of Chartiers, in
Southwestern Pennsylvania. As soon as he became settled
in his new home he began in a very earnest way to exercise
his ministry as a member of the presbytery, which embraced
a number of counties. He had come to this country
as a zealous missionary of the cross, filled with the love
of souls. Already in Ireland, through various influences,
he had learned to cherish a liberal religious spirit, to esteem
as of little value the barriers that separate into sects.</p>
<h4 id="c70">CONFLICT WITH THE SECEDERS</h4>
<p>The Seceders constitute one of the &ldquo;straitest sects&rdquo; of
the Calvinistic faith, and even to this day they will not affiliate
in full fraternal fellowship with other Presbyterians.
It was in the matter of the communion that the severe test of
fellowship was applied. Thomas Campbell had come to this
country with his heart filled with a burning zeal to labor in
the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard, and in largest charity for all communions,
while still maintaining sincerely and fully his
relations to his particular communion. He believed that
in this freest land men&rsquo;s hearts would necessarily be emancipated
from the unyielding sectarian prejudices and animosities
of the Old World. While eminently prudent and
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
peace-loving, he was a man of heroic temper. He would
not temporize nor bow to the tyrannous dictates of human
traditions or human policy. &ldquo;This grave spirit he had already
shown in his early youth, when he decided from conviction
not to follow the religion of his father, who was
attached to the Church of England, and preferred, as he
used to say, &lsquo;to worship God according to act of Parliament.&rsquo;
&lsquo;The law of the Lord, in the word and spirit of the
Gospel, which is &lsquo;the law of liberty,&rsquo; was Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s
supreme rule of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to unfold the events which led to the
final crisis that inaugurated actually and in a formal manner
the restoration movement. The Seceders were not very
numerous within the limits of the Chartiers Presbytery; the
power of expansion was not in them. Mr. Campbell at
once gained a wide and strong influence. His natural
ability, his scholarship and literary culture, made him much
superior to the preachers in that region; and his deep religious
fervor and zeal and his rare courtesy of manner won
the hearts of the people. He did not respect in his labors
the narrow spirit and strict, illiberal rules and habits of the
Seceder Church. Besides this, he had found near him a
number of excellent people who had come over from Ireland,
Presbyterians and Independents, some of whom had been
his acquaintance and cherished friends in his native land.
These gathered around him, and he promptly took them to
his heart in his ministrations as brethren. This kind of
freedom, however, was not in harmony with &ldquo;the usages&rdquo; of
the Seceders. Later on he took a step which went even
further than this, and thus in a very decided way transgressed
the established custom of the Church.</p>
<p>He was sent on a missionary tour with a young preacher,
a Mr. Wilson, up the Allegheny Valley, above Pittsburgh,
&ldquo;to hold a celebration of the sacrament among the scattered
Seceders of that then sparsely-settled region. He found
there many members of other Presbyterian bodies who had
not for a long time enjoyed the privilege of these by them
so highly-cherished occasions. His heart urged him to deplore
in his introductory sermon the existing divisions among
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
Christians, and to invite all the pious among his hearers,
who were prepared for it, to unite in the participation of
this sacred feast of God&rsquo;s people; and many accepted the
invitation. This was a bold infraction of Seceder custom.&rdquo;
Campbell could have no fellowship with such
bigotry. Mr. Wilson soon discovered that Campbell had
no regard for sectarian differences and prejudices and that
he was not sound in the Seceder faith. &ldquo;His conduct of
inviting those not of his Church to partake of the communion
was an overt act of extreme transgression that could not be
overlooked;&rdquo; but he made no objection at the time this grave
offense was committed. He felt it his duty, however, to
bring the matter before the presbytery at its next meeting.
The charge contained several complaints, but the principal
one was this public act in regard to the communion. It
recited, moreover, that &ldquo;Campbell had expressed his disapprobation
of things in the &lsquo;Standards&rsquo; and of the practical
application of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The presbytery, already much dissatisfied with his liberal
course, readily took up Wilson&rsquo;s charges. But they had
before them a man who, although ever remarkably inclined
to peace and warmly attached to the Seceder Church, would,
nevertheless, not yield to any human authority against his
convictions in matters of serious import. The present was
a decisive moment in his life, reaching in its effects far beyond
what was then thought.</p>
<p>After an investigation, which called from him a most
earnest plea in behalf of Christian liberty and fraternity, he
was found deserving of censure. In vain did he protest
the treatment he had received at the hands of his brethren.
In vain did he appeal from the presbytery to the synod.
Party spirit was unyielding. He had expressed sentiments,
it insisted, which were &ldquo;very different from sentiments held
and professed by the Church.&rdquo; This, it held, was an altogether
sufficient ground of censure. From that time many
of his fellow ministers became inimical to him and were
disposed to inflict on him at every opportunity their petty
persecutions.</p>
<p>Unjust as he felt the censure of the synod to be, yet so
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
strong was his love of peace and his desire to continue to
live and labor with his brethren that he submitted to it;
the condition, however, expressed in a written form to this
tribunal &ldquo;that his submission should be understood to mean
no more, on his part, than an act of deference to the judgment
of the court; that by so doing he might not give offense
to his brethren by manifesting a refractory spirit.&rdquo; After
this concession he hoped that he would be permitted to continue
his labors in peace; but, much to his regret, the
hostility of his opponents continued. Misrepresentations,
calumny, anything that would detract from his influence,
were employed against him. Spies were employed
to attend his meetings, that, if possible, they might find fresh
ground of accusation in his utterances. At last, worn out
with these efforts, and having satisfied himself that corruption,
bigotry and tyranny were inherent in existing
clerical organizations, he decided to sever his connection
with the religious body to which he had given life-long support,
renouncing the authority of the presbytery and synod.
That this final decisive step caused him much grief can not
for a moment be doubted; but it is certain, also, that the
freedom which it gave him, as a servant of God, must have
been to him a genuine joy and an impartation of a strength
of soul he never knew before.</p>
<p>These painful experiences soon led to important consequences.
By his forced withdrawal from the presbytery
he found himself without church affiliations. But this only
quickened his zeal in the efforts to extend Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.
He had gained a wide and strong influence in the region in
which he lived. No meeting houses were at his command;
but he held his assemblies, after the pioneer fashion, in
private dwellings, barns, schoolhouses and under green trees.
In these labors it was no part of his plan to organize a
separate religious party. Such parties were already too
numerous. At first it seems that he had no definite plan of
action. He had simply determined to use his strength in
such ways as Providence should open to him, in putting an
end to partyism, by inducing the different denominations to
unite together on the Bible. In this purpose many of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
neighbors heartily sympathized with him, though shrinking
from the conclusions to which they were being irresistably
driven.</p>
<p>At last the time seemed ripe for some forward movement.
He therefore determined to adopt what he believed
to be the best course to promote the interest of his Master&rsquo;s
cause. He saw that many of his hearers sincerely, some
ardently, had accepted the principles he was advocating and
were constant in attendance on his ministry. He consequently
proposed to them that they meet together and consult
on the best method to give more order, definiteness and
permanency to their efforts. This met with ready and general
approbation. A day was named and at the appointed
hour a large company assembled in an old farmhouse in the
neighborhood. The company was composed of thoughtful
men and women, deeply conscious of the importance of the
occasion. They were plain, hard-working pioneers, but they
were men and women of faith, whose hearts were pained at
the division into warring sects and parties. Though belonging
to different religious parties, they had met to seek a
pathway of closer fellowship.</p>
<p>A feeling of deep solemnity pervaded the entire assembly,
when at length Mr. Campbell arose to address them.
The theme of the occasion had grown to be the burden of
his heart. He gave a clear exposition of the situation and
of the object of the assembly. The events that had led to
the calling of this meeting, well understood by all, had made
a deep impression upon them. The discourse was a strong
argument against sectarian divisions and in behalf of Christian
unity on the Bible as the only infallible standard of
doctrine and practice, to the rejection of all human traditions.
He concluded this remarkable discourse by urging
with great earnestness the adoption of the following principles
as the rule of their future action and life as Christians:
&ldquo;<i>Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the Scriptures
are silent, we are silent.</i>&rdquo; This bold maxim was so
just that no one of the audience, prepared as they were by
previous teaching, could for a moment hesitate to accept it
as right. These people could not help seeing the effect of
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
this law on some of the most familiar practices of the denominations
to which most of them belonged.</p>
<h4 id="c71">THE DECLARATION AND ADDRESS</h4>
<p>This discourse to which reference has been made, closed
with: &ldquo;Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the
Scriptures are silent, we are silent,&rdquo; and produced a profound
impression on the audience. The majority of the
audience were ready, unhesitatingly, to give a hearty assent
to this great declaration. But the troublesome question
arose, &ldquo;Where will it lead us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Campbell had concluded, opportunity was
given for free expression of views, whereupon Andrew
Munro, a shrewd Scotch Seceder, arose and said: &ldquo;Mr.
Campbell, if we adopt that as a basis, then there is an end
of infant baptism.&rdquo; This remark and the manifest conviction
that it carried with it, produced a great sensation,
for the whole audience was composed of pedobaptists who
cherish infant baptism as one of their cardinal doctrines.
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Campbell, in reply, &ldquo;if infant baptism
is not found in Scripture we can have nothing to do with
it.&rdquo; This bold declaration came like a new revelation to
the audience. Thomas Acheson, one of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s
closest friends, in a very excited manner arose and said:
&ldquo;I hope I may never see the day when my heart will renounce
that blessed saying of the Scripture, &lsquo;Suffer the little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such
is the kingdom of heaven!&rsquo;&rdquo; Upon saying this he burst
into tears, and was about to retire to the adjoining room
when James Foster, well informed in the Scriptures, called
out, &ldquo;Mr. Acheson, I would remark that in the portion of
Scripture you have quoted there is no reference to infant
baptism.&rdquo; Without offering a reply Mr. Acheson passed
into the adjoining room to weep alone.</p>
<p>This new turn of things, so unexpected to them, did not
lessen their confidence in the position they had taken, or in
the man who was leading them onward. At the end of the
conference the great principle was adopted without any real
opposition. It would have been difficult for them to object
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
to a profession so manifestly loyal to God and so impregnably
founded in the Holy Scriptures. The principle, so universal
in its application, and its controlling authority in all
things that concern the faith and practice of the followers
of the Lord Jesus Christ, became henceforth the watchword
and directive law of action of those endeavoring to restore
apostolic Christianity. Some of those who started out in
this great movement, when they saw more clearly the inevitable,
logical result of the great principle now adopted,
one after another broke off all connection with this work.</p>
<p>They now began to feel that in order to carry out with
successful effect this noble purpose they must organize
themselves into a well-ordered, permanent association. At
a meeting held August 17, 1809, it was decided that they
would formally unite themselves into a regular body, under
the name of &ldquo;The Christian Association of Washington.&rdquo;
They then appointed twenty-one of their number to meet
and confer together, and, with the assistance of Thomas
Campbell, to determine upon the proper means to carry into
effect their purposes. As it was found to be very inconvenient
to hold meetings in private houses, it was deemed
advisable to provide some regular place of meeting. The
neighbors, as was customary in those days, all moved by
good will for the excellent man and his purposes, assembled
and erected a log building three miles from Mount Pleasant,
Washington County, Pa. This building was designed, also,
for the purpose of a common school, which was much
needed in that neighborhood. No ecclesiastical aspirations,
no sectarian ambition, no party purpose or name, entered
into the erection of this humble building. The name and
cause of Christ alone prompted and sanctified the act of
these honest souls.</p>
<p>Near by, in the house of Mr. Welch, a worthy farmer
who was friendly to the association, Mr. Campbell had a
home. A little chamber upstairs was assigned to him as his
apartment. Here he spent his leisure time in quiet study,
for he felt that he needed these days of undisturbed retirement
to prepare himself to meet, in wisdom and the fear
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
of God, the crisis through which he and those united with
him were passing. The writing with which he was at this
time engaged was designed to set forth to the public at large,
in a clear and definite manner, the character and purposes
of the association. In the &ldquo;prophet&rsquo;s chamber&rdquo; Thomas
Campbell wrote the &ldquo;Declaration and Address&rdquo; which became
so famous in the early history of the effort to restore
apostolic Christianity. When it was finished he called a
special meeting of the chief members and read it to them
for their approval and adoption. This meeting unanimously
approved it and ordered its publication September 7, 1809.</p>
<p>This production is, in its substance and spirit, as well
as in its vigorous and scholarly style, the most notable historical
production of the initiatory period of the effort to
restore the apostolic church in its doctrine and practice, and
is worthy of diligent and thoughtful study at the present
day. It is proper, therefore, that I should note the essential
principles therein set forth. The admirable introduction
setting forth and deploring the divided state among the professed
followers of the Savior concluded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our desire, therefore, for ourselves and our brethren
would be that, rejecting human opinions and the inventions
of men as of any authority, or as having any place in the
Church of God, we might forever cease from further contentions
about such things, returning to and holding fast by the
original standard, taking the divine Word alone for our rule,
the Holy Spirit for our teacher and guide to lead us into all
truth, and Christ alone as exhibited in the Word for our salvation;
and that by so doing we may be at peace among ourselves,
follow peace with all men and holiness, without which
no man shall see the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a statement of the purpose and program
of the association: To form a religious association for promoting
simple and evangelical Christianity, under the name
of the &ldquo;Christian Association of Washington&rdquo;; to contribute
a certain sum to support a pure Gospel ministry and
supply the poor with the Scriptures; to encourage the formation
of similar associations; to consider itself not a church,
but as a church reformation society; to countenance only
such ministers as adhere closely to the example and precept
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
of Scripture in conduct and teaching; to entrust the management
of the association to a standing committee of twenty-one;
to hold two meetings a year; to open each meeting
with a sermon; and to look to the friends of genuine Christianity
for the support of their work.</p>
<p>This is followed by the address, with the following
dedicatory heading: &ldquo;To all that love our Lord Jesus Christ,
in sincerity, throughout all the churches, the following address
is most respectfully submitted.&rdquo; After an arraignment
of the evils of divisions and an indictment of sectarianism,
he pleads with his &ldquo;dearly beloved brethren&rdquo; of &ldquo;all
the churches&rdquo; &ldquo;to unite in the bonds of an entire Christian
unity&mdash;Christ alone being the head, the center, his word
the rule; and explicit belief of and manifest conformity to
it in all things&mdash;the terms.&rdquo; Thus to &ldquo;come firmly and
fairly to original ground, and take up things just as the
apostles left them.&rdquo; In this way they could become &ldquo;disentangled
from the accruing embarrassments of intervening
ages,&rdquo; and stand &ldquo;upon the same ground on which the
church stood at the beginning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, indeed, was the
startling proposition to begin anew&mdash;to begin at the beginning;
to ascend at once to the pure fountain of truth, and
to neglect and disregard, as though they had never been, the
decrees of popes, cardinals, synods and assemblies, and all
the traditions and corruptions of an apostate church. Here
was an effort not so much for the reformation of the church
as was that of Luther and of Calvin and of Haldanes, but
for its complete restoration at once to its pristine purity
and perfection. By coming at once to the primitive model
and rejecting all human imaginations; by submitting implicitly
to the divine authority as plainly expressed in the
Scriptures, and by disregarding all the assumptions and dictations
of fallible men, it was proposed to form a union
upon a basis to which no valid objection could possibly be
offered. By this summary method the church was to be
at once released from the controversies of eighteen centuries,
and from conflicting claims of all pretenders to apostolic
thrones, and the primitive Gospel of salvation was to be disentangled
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
and disembarrassed from all those corruptions and
perversions which had heretofore delayed or arrested its
progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were certain &ldquo;fundamental truths&rdquo; of the nature
of &ldquo;first principles,&rdquo; &ldquo;truths demonstrably evident in the
light of Scripture and right reason,&rdquo; which <i>underly</i> the
proposal for a union of the professed followers of Christ.
These are so interesting and important that I deem it wise
to give them, for they need to be diligently and profoundly
studied by the present generation. They are summed up
in the following propositions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. That the Church of Christ upon earth is essentially,
intentionally and constitutionally one; consisting of all those
in every place that profess their faith in Christ and obedience
to him in all things according to the Scriptures, and that manifest
the same by their tempers and conduct, and of none else;
as none else can be truly and properly called Christians.</p>
<p>2. That although the Church of Christ upon earth must
necessarily exist in particular and distinct societies, locally
separate one from another, yet there ought to be no schisms,
no uncharitable divisions among them. They ought to receive
each other as Christ Jesus hath also received them, to the
glory of God. And for this purpose they ought all to walk
by the same rule, to mind and speak the same thing, and to
be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.</p>
<p>3. That in order to this nothing ought to be inculcated
upon Christians as articles of faith, nor required of them as
terms of communion, but what is expressly taught and enjoined
upon them in the Word of God. Nor ought anything to be
admitted as of divine obligation, in their church constitution
and management, but what is expressly enjoined by the authority
of our Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles upon the New
Testament Church, either in express terms or by approved
precedent.</p>
<p>4. That although the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments are inseparably connected, making together but
one perfect and entire revelation of the divine will, for the
edification and salvation of the Church, and therefore in that
respect can not be separated, yet as to what directly and properly
belongs to their immediate object, the New Testament is as
perfect a constitution for the worship, discipline and government
of the New Testament Church, and as perfect a rule
for the particular duties of its members, as the Old Testament
was for the worship, discipline and government of the Old
Testament Church, and the particular duties of its members.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>5. That with respect to the commands and ordinances of
our Lord Jesus Christ, where the Scriptures are silent as to
the express time or manner of performance, if any such there
be, no human authority has power to interfere, in order to
supply deficiency by making laws for the Church; nor can
anything more be required of Christians in such cases, but
only that they so observe these commands and ordinances as
will evidently answer the declared and obvious end of their
institution. Much less have any human authority power to
impose new commands or ordinances upon the Church, which
our Lord Jesus Christ has not enjoined. Nothing ought to
be received into the faith or worship of the Church, or be
made a term of communion among Christians, that is not as
old as the New Testament.</p>
<p>6. That although inferences and deductions from Scripture
premises, when fairly inferred, may be truly called the
doctrine of God&rsquo;s holy Word, yet are they not formally binding
upon the consciences of Christians farther than they perceive
the connection, and evidently see that they are so; for
their faith must not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power and veracity of God. Therefore no such deductions
can be made the terms of communion, but do properly belong
to the after and progressive edification of the Church. Hence,
it is evident that no such deductions or inferential truth ought
to have any place in the Church&rsquo;s confession.</p>
<p>7. That although doctrinal exhibitions of the great system
of divine truths and defensive testimonies in opposition to prevailing
errors be highly expedient, and the more full and explicit
they be for those purposes the better; yet, as these must
be in a great measure the effect of human reasoning, and of
course must contain many inferential truths, they ought not
to be made terms of Christian communion, unless we suppose,
what is contrary to fact, that none have a right to the communion
of the Church, but such as possess a very clear and
decisive judgment, or are come to a very high degree of doctrinal
information; whereas the Church from the beginning
did, and ever will, consist of little children and young men,
as well as fathers.</p>
<p>8. That as it is not necessary that persons should have
a particular knowledge or distinct apprehension of all divinely-revealed
truths in order to entitle them to a place in the
Church, neither should they, for this purpose, be required to
make a profession more extensive than their knowledge; but
that, on the contrary, their having a due measure of scriptural
self-knowledge respecting their lost and perishing condition
by nature and practice, and of the way of salvation through
Jesus Christ, accompanied with a profession of their faith in
the obedience to him, in all things, according to his Word, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
all that is absolutely necessary to qualify them for admission
into his Church.</p>
<p>9. That all who are able through grace to make such a
profession, and to manifest the reality of it in their tempers
and conduct, should consider each other as the precious saints
of God, should love each other as brethren, children of the
same family and Father, temples of the same Spirit, members
of the same body, subjects of the same grace, objects of
the same divine love, bought with the same price, and joint-heirs
of the same inheritance. Whom God hath thus joined
together no man should dare put asunder.</p>
<p>10. That divisions among the Christians is a horrid evil,
fraught with many evils. It is anti-Christian, as it destroys
the visible unity of the body of Christ; as if he were divided
against himself, excluding and excommunicating a part of himself.
It is anti-scriptural, as being strictly prohibited by his
sovereign authority, a direct violation of his express command.
It is anti-natural, as it excites Christians to condemn, to hate
and oppose one another, where bound by the highest and most
endearing obligation to love each other as brethren, even as
Christ has loved them. In a word, it is productive of confusion
and of every evil work.</p>
<p>11. That (in some instances) a partial neglect of the expressly
revealed will of God, and (in others) an assumed authority
for making the approbation of human opinions and of
human inventions a term of communion, by introducing them
into the constitution, faith or worship of the Church, are, and
have been, the immediate, obvious and universally acknowledged
causes of all corruptions and divisions that ever have
taken place in the Church of God.</p>
<p>12. That all that is necessary to the highest state of
perfection and purity of the Church upon earth is, first, that
none be received as members, but such as, having that due
measure of scriptural self-knowledge described above, do profess
their faith in Christ and obedience to him in all things
according to the Scriptures; nor, secondly, that any be retained
in her communion longer than they continue to manifest the
reality of their profession by their temper and conduct.
Thirdly, that her ministers, duly and scripturally qualified,
inculcate none other things than those very articles of faith
and holiness expressly revealed and enjoined in the Word of
God. Lastly, that in all their administrations they keep close
by the observance of all divine ordinances, after the example
of the primitive Church, exhibited in the New Testament, without
any additions whatever of human opinions or inventions
of men.</p>
<p>13. Lastly, that if any circumstantials indispensably

upon the pages of express revelation, such, and such only, as
are absolutely necessary for this purpose should be adopted
under the title of human expedients, without any pretense to
a more sacred origin, so that any subsequent alteration or
difference in the observance of these things might produce no
contention nor division in the Church. (&ldquo;Memoirs of Thomas
Campbell,&rdquo; pages 48-52.)</p>

<h3 id="c72">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="h3line2">ALEXANDER CAMPBELL</span></h3>
<p>Alexander Campbell, the son, arrived in this country
September 29, 1809, just as the proof sheets of the Declaration
and Address were coming from the press, and as a
matter of the first concern with him, Thomas Campbell gave
a full detail of the events already related to his son, and
desired especially that he should read and consider the
Declaration and Address. This Alexander did, and fell in
heartily with the action of his father and the principles set
forth therein. A new world of thought and life was now
opened to him. He had spent one of the two years of
separation in study at the University of Glasgow, where his
father had formerly studied, and while there came more
intimately under the influence of the new ideas and movements
of the country. There he had met Greville Ewing,
the Haldanes, and other religious leaders of the time who
were pressing for larger liberty of religious service under
the rule of a stricter conformity to the Scriptures, and had
in a large measure imbibed these principles. He had not
had the courage to write to his father of his change of convictions
from the old church, and now feared that his
changed course would bring him deep pain. In this attitude
of mind the meeting between father and son took place.
Happy was the surprise when each learned that the other
no longer adhered to the old religious party in which they
had been reared.</p>
<h4 id="c73">SUBJECT AND ACT OF BAPTISM SETTLED</h4>
<p>While reading the proof sheets of the Declaration and
Address, Alexander Campbell had a conversation on the
principles set forth therein with a Mr. Riddle, of the Presbyterian
Church, whom he accidentally met. When the
proposition that &ldquo;nothing should be required as a matter of
faith or duty for which a &lsquo;Thus saith the Lord&rsquo; could not
be produced either in express terms or by approved precedent,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
was introduced, Mr. Riddle very promptly replied
that the words, however plausible in appearance, were not
sound; for if that were followed it would be necessary to
abandon infant baptism. To which he replied, &ldquo;Why, sir,
is there in the Scriptures no express precept nor precedent
for infant baptism?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not one, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>This reply startled and mortified Mr. Campbell, and
shortly afterward he mentioned the suggested difficulty to
his father, who replied, &ldquo;We make our appeal to the law
and the testimony. Whatever is not found therein must of
course be abandoned.&rdquo; Not willing to remain in uncertainty
on the subject, he procured all the books and tracts
he could favorable to the practice. On reading them he
was disgusted with the assumptions and fallacious reasonings
to sustain the practice, and threw them aside with
the faint hope of finding something more convincing in the
Greek New Testament. &ldquo;This, however, only made the
matter worse, and upon again entering into a conversation
with his father on the subject he found him entirely willing
to admit that there were neither &lsquo;express terms&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;precedent&rsquo; to authorize the practice. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;as for
those who are already members of the church and participants
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, I can see no propriety, even if
the scriptural evidence for infant baptism be found deficient,
in their unchurching or paganizing themselves, or in putting
off Christ, merely for the sake of making a new profession;
thus going out of the church merely for the sake of coming
in again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this it seems that he was disposed only to concede
that they ought not to teach nor practice infant baptism
without divine authority, and that they should preach
and practice scriptural baptism in regard to all who were
to make, for the first time, a profession of faith. In deference
to his views, the son dismissed the subject for the time,
&ldquo;seemingly satisfied with the fallacious reasoning imposed
by circumstances, which prevented his father from seeing
then the real position which baptism occupied in the Christian
economy, and consequently from making, in regard to
it, a practical application of his own principles.&rdquo; With this
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
Alexander Campbell seems to have suspended his investigation
of the subject, and to have foreborne giving to it that
impartial and continued attention necessary to the discovery
of truth. In a discourse delivered June 5, 1811, on Christ&rsquo;s
commission to his apostles (Mark 16:15,16), he said, in
reference to baptism: &ldquo;As I am sure it is unscriptural to
make this matter [baptism] a term of communion, I let it
slip. I wish to think and let think on these matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But circumstances came up later which compelled him
to give it a most painstaking examination. He was married
March 12, 1811, and on March 13, 1812, his first child was
born. Soon after this event a great change took place in
his views in regard to baptism. His wife, with her father
and mother, was still a member of the Presbyterian Church,
and, as the child grew, it was natural that the subject of
infant baptism should become one of immediate practical
interest. As viewed from the viewpoint of his early education,
infant baptism was a rite justified, inferentially at
least, and not to be neglected; but viewed from the principles
set forth in the Declaration and Address it possessed
no divine authority, yet as an ancient and venerated practice,
and for the sake of peace, it seemed to his father and to
himself expedient to allow its continuance in the case of such
members as conscientiously believed it proper. Most of the
members of the church, furthermore, supposed themselves
to have been baptized into the church in their infancy. From
the occasional discussions of the subject among the members
of the Brush Run Church, there was an increasing conviction
on the part of many that baptism was a matter of
much more importance than had been generally supposed,
and now his changed relationship caused him to share in
this conviction. Admitting that infant baptism is without
divine warrant assumed a very different aspect, and was
no longer, &ldquo;May we safely reject infant baptism as a mere
human invention?&rdquo; but, &ldquo;May we omit believers&rsquo; baptism,
which all admit to be divinely commanded?&rdquo; In other
words, if infant baptism is without divine warrant, it is
invalid, and they who receive it are as a matter of fact still
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
unbaptized. &ldquo;When they come to know this in after years,
will God accept the credulity of the parent for the faith of
the child?&rdquo; &ldquo;Men may be pleased to omit faith on the
part of the person baptized, but will God sanction the omission
of baptism on the part of the believer, on the ground
that in his infancy he had been the subject of a ceremony
which had not been enjoined?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the other hand, if the
practice of infant baptism can be justified by inferential
reasoning on any sufficient evidence, why should it not be
adopted or continued by common consent, without further
discussion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the thoughts which at this time passed
through the mind of Alexander Campbell. Desiring to
maintain &ldquo;a conscience void of offense toward God and
men,&rdquo; and sensible of the responsibilities resting upon him
in the new relationship which he sustained as a father, he
was led to think more earnestly and seriously upon the whole
subject, so that he might not come short in any duty that
God had placed upon him. At this point he parted company
with all uninspired authorities and turned to the Greek
New Testament and diligently applied himself to the meaning
of the words translated into the English by the words
&ldquo;baptize&rdquo; and &ldquo;baptism,&rdquo; and soon became thoroughly satisfied
that the act indicated by them could not be performed
short of a burial of the subject in water. By further investigations
he was led to the strong conviction that believers,
and believers only, were the scriptural subjects of
the ordinance. &ldquo;He now fully perceived that the rite of
sprinkling to which he had been subjected in infancy was
wholly unauthorized, and that he was, consequently, in point
of fact, an unbaptized person, and hence could not consistently
preach a baptism to others of which he had never
been a subject himself.&rdquo; The subject was of such serious
and anxious inquiry that he frequently conversed with his
wife on the subject; she also became interested in it, and
finally reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Having now reached such a definite conclusion in regard
to the matter, he could not long refrain from putting his
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
convictions into practice, so he resolved to obey what he
now found to be a positive, divine command. Some time
prior to this he had formed an acquaintance with Matthias
Luce, a Baptist preacher, who lived some thirty miles distant,
to whom he now decided to apply to perform the rite.
On his way to see him he called to see his father and the
family. Soon after his arrival his sister, Dorothea, took
him aside and told him that she had been in great trouble for
some time in regard to the validity of her baptism, as she
could find no authority whatever in the New Testament for
infant baptism, and as she had received nothing else, could
not resist the conviction that she had never been baptized,
and requested him to lay her difficulties before her father.
To this unexpected announcement he responded that he
also had reached the same conclusion and was then on his
way to arrange with Mr. Luce to immerse him, and that
he would lay the whole matter before their father. Accordingly
he sought and obtained an interview with him;
discussed the subject at some length, and concluded with
these words: &ldquo;I now fully and conscientiously believe that
I have never been baptized, and consequently I am, in point
of fact, an unbaptized person; and hence can not consistently
preach baptism to others, as I have never submitted to it
myself.&rdquo; To this his father responded, &ldquo;I have, then, nothing
further to add. You must please yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Alexander was leaving the next morning, his father
said: &ldquo;When, where, and by whom do you intend to be
immersed?&rdquo; To which Alexander replied: &ldquo;As to the
place, I prefer to be baptized near home, among those who
are accustomed to hear my preaching; as to the time, just
as soon as I can make arrangements with a suitable Baptist
preacher. I will let you know as soon as I make the
necessary arrangements.&rdquo; The interview with Mr. Luce
was satisfactory and everything was satisfactorily arranged.
Mr. Richardson gives the following interesting account of
the baptism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wednesday, June 12, 1812, having been selected, Elder
Luce, in company with Elder Henry Spears, called at Thomas
Campbell&rsquo;s on their way to the place chosen for the immersion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
which was the deep pool in Buffalo Creek, where three members
of the Association had formerly been baptized. Next
morning, as they were setting out, Thomas Campbell simply
remarked that Mrs. Campbell had put up a change of raiment
for herself and him, which was the first intimation that they
also intended to be immersed. Upon arriving at the place, as
the greater part of the Brush Run Church, with a large concourse
of others, attracted by the novelty of the occasion, were
assembled at David Bryant&rsquo;s house, near the place, Thomas
Campbell thought it proper to present, in full, the reasons
which had determined his course. In a long address he reviewed
the entire ground which he had occupied, and the
struggles that he had undergone in reference to the particular
subject of baptism, which he had earnestly desired to dispose
of, in such a manner that it might be no hindrance in the
attainment of that Christian unity which he had labored to
establish on the Bible alone. In endeavoring to do this he
admitted that he had been led to overlook its importance, and
the very many plain and obvious teachings of the Scriptures
on the subject; but having at length attained a clearer view
of duty, he felt it incumbent upon him to submit to what he
now saw an important Divine institution. Alexander afterwards
followed with an extended defense of their proceedings,
urging the necessity of submitting implicitly to all God&rsquo;s commandments,
and showing that the baptism of believers only was
authorized by the Word of God.</p>
<p>In his remarks, he had quoted, among other scriptures, the
command of Peter to the believers on the day of Pentecost:
&ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift
of the Holy Spirit;&rdquo; and had dwelt at length upon the gracious
promises of God to all who should obey him. When he had
concluded, James Hanan, who, with his wife, had also concluded
to be baptized, took his child from its mother&rsquo;s arms
and requested her to walk aside, asked her what she thought of
the declaration of Peter, &ldquo;You shall receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and how she understood it. Mrs. Hanan, being
well acquainted with the Scriptures, soon gave a satisfactory
reply, and both were accordingly baptized along with the rest,
consisting of Alexander Campbell and his wife, his father and
mother, and his sister&mdash;in all, seven persons. Alexander had
stipulated with Elder Luce that the ceremony should be performed
precisely according to the pattern given in the New
Testament, and that, as there was no account of any of the
first converts being called upon to give what is called &ldquo;a religious
experience,&rdquo; this modern custom should be omitted, and
that the candidates should be admitted on the simple confession
that &ldquo;Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo; These points he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
fully discussed with Luce during the evening spent at his
house when he first went up to request his attendance, and
they had been arranged as he desired. Elder Luce had, indeed,
at first objected to these changes, as being contrary to Baptist
usage, but finally consented, remarking that he believed they
were right, and he would run the risk of censure. There
were not, therefore, upon this occasion, any of the usual forms
of receiving persons into the Church upon a detailed account
of religious feelings and impressions.... All were, therefore,
admitted to immersion upon making the simple confession
of Christ required of the converts in the apostolic times.
The meeting, it is related, continued seven hours. (Memoirs of
A. Campbell, Vol. I, pages 396-398.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a week of the immersion of the Campbells and
their group, thirteen other members of the Brush Run
Church asked to be immersed, and it was done by Thomas
Campbell, upon a simple confession of their faith in Jesus
Christ as the Son of God. It was not long before the entire
church of thirty or more members were immersed, for those
who did not accept immersion withdrew from the church
and united with some of the denominations in the community.
Immersion became a condition of union and communion
with the Brush Run Church. Its conversion into
a company of immersed believers did not bring them any
favor from the pedobaptist churches of the community.</p>
<p>The Brush Run Church had come to its position under
the guidance of primitive apostolic example and its application
to every item of faith and practice which is adopted in
its order. It was not seeking agreement with any religious
body, but &ldquo;the old paths,&rdquo; agreement with the &ldquo;original
standard,&rdquo; &ldquo;that it might come fairly and firmly to original
ground upon clear and certain premises, and take up things
just as the apostles left them.&rdquo; It was feeling its way and
making sure of its ground as it went. It knew of no religious
body that stood upon original ground; none that
dared to return to the original standard. The sense of
freedom which it enjoyed in being bound only by the New
Testament with respect to all doctrines and practices, was
equaled only by the sense of certainty it enjoyed in being
infallibly guided by the New Testament to the true conditions
of unity and communion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h4 id="c74">THE REDSTONE ASSOCIATION</h4>
<p>As was to be expected, the attitude of the Brush Run
Church in becoming a body of immersed believers awakened
a storm of opposition from the pedobaptist ranks, and its
members became the subjects of no little persecution. Misrepresentations
of all kinds, were freely circulated among
the people. Family and friendship ties were broken, and
the common civilities of society were denied to this new
order of &ldquo;heretics.&rdquo; It is related that Alexander Campbell,
returning after nightfall from one of his appointments about
this time, was overtaken by a violent storm. Calling at the
house of a member of the Seceder Church, he asked for
shelter from the violence of the storm. Before granting
his request she desired to know his name. On being informed
she promptly refused him admittance, giving as her
reason her hostility to his religious views. So he was
forced to continue his journey through an almost trackless
forest, until he reached his home. These trials, so far from
discouraging this feeble band of earnest searchers for the
truth, served rather to strengthen their faith and zeal. Convinced
of the correctness of their course, they were drawn
more closely to each other by the petty persecutions which
they were now called upon to suffer. &ldquo;They often visited
each other&rsquo;s houses, frequently spending the greater portion
of the night in social prayer, in searching the Scriptures,
asking and answering questions, and singing hymns of
praise.&rdquo; Thus was laid, in obscurity and adversity, the
foundation of the great work of returning to the &ldquo;example
of the primitive Christians exhibited in the New Testament;
without any addition whatever of human opinions or inventions
of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new situation now confronted them. When the Baptists
heard of the action of the Brush Run Church in submitting
to immersion and adopting it in their practice, they
were highly elated and began to urge the church to join the
Redstone Association, which embraced all the Baptist
churches of that region. Alexander Campbell had not been
favorably impressed with the Baptists, either as ministers
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
or people, and had no idea of uniting with them. He, however,
liked the people better, and the preachers less, the
more he became acquainted with them. He did not press
himself upon their attention, but they knew his power as a
preacher and often sent for him to preach for them. He
visited their association which convened at Uniontown, Pa.,
in the autumn of 1812. He went as a spectator, and returned
more disgusted than when he went. He was invited
to preach, but he declined, except one evening in a private
family, &ldquo;to a dozen preachers and twice as many laymen.&rdquo;
He returned home not intending ever to visit another association.
Later on he learned that the Baptists themselves
did not appreciate the preaching or the preachers of that
association. They regarded the speakers as worse than
usual, and their discourses as not at all edifying. Then
they pressed on Mr. Campbell from every quarter to visit
their churches, and preach for them. He often spoke to
Baptist congregations for sixty miles around.</p>
<p>The matter of joining the Redstone Association was laid
before the Brush Run Church in the fall of 1813. They
discussed the propriety of the measure. After much discussion
and earnest desire to be directed by the wisdom that
cometh down from above, they finally concluded to make
an overture to that effect, and to write out a full view of
their sentiments, wishes and determinations on the subject.
They did so, exhibiting their remonstrance against all human
creeds as bonds of communion and union among Christians,
and expressing a willingness, upon certain conditions, to
co-operate or unite with that association, provided always
that they should be allowed to teach and preach whatever
they learned from the Holy Scriptures, regardless of any
creed or formula in Christendom.</p>
<p>The proposition was discussed at the association, and,
after much debate, was decided by a good majority in favor
of their being received. Thus a union was formed. But
the party opposed, though small, began early to work, and
continued with a perseverance worthy of a better cause. But
for three years they could do nothing. The situation in
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
which Mr. Campbell found himself, soon after his connection
with the Redstone Association of the Baptist
churches, was not at all inviting. The originality of his
method in dealing with the Scriptures, and his utter disregard
for customs, however time-honored, which were not
sanctioned by primitive precept or example, awakened the
suspicion of the more narrow-minded of the Baptist preachers,
who were not slow in manifesting their disapproval.
His popularity among the churches of the association no
doubt added to their displeasure, and at every opportunity
he was made to feel the sting of their resentment. This
hostility, which at first manifested itself in slights and little
annoyances, at last led to an open attack upon his teachings.</p>
<p>When the association met at Cross Creek in August,
1816, in spite of the intrigues of his enemies he was appointed
as one of the speakers, on which occasion he preached
his great &ldquo;Sermon on the Law.&rdquo; In that discourse he sharply
discriminated between the law of Moses and the Gospel,
showing that the former had served its purpose, and that
its authority had passed away when the kingdom of the
Messiah was established. This marked another important
advance in the progress of the efforts to return to apostolic
Christianity. The distinction between the law and the
Gospel, the old covenant and the new, the letter and the
spirit, the Jewish commonwealth and the kingdom, had been
greatly obscured in popular thought. It was claimed that
the law was still alive, and that Christians come under its
provisions as such, with the exception of its strictly ceremonial
parts, and that the church under the Christian dispensation
is the same that existed under the Jewish dispensation.
The sermon, though containing but plain Scripture
teaching, was such a bold assault upon the theology and
style of preaching current among the Baptists that it created
a great sensation in the association, and raised a storm of
persecution. The common people were, for the most part,
pleased with his simple, natural presentation of the truth,
but this only added fuel to the flame of bitterness which
some of the preachers cherished against him. &ldquo;This will
never do,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;this is not our doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>In consequence of the views presented in this sermon,
Mr. Campbell was &ldquo;brought up for trial and condemnation&rdquo;
at the next meeting of the association in the autumn of 1817.
At that time but few were ready to accept the conclusion
in the sermon, and the actual adherents of the teaching,
scattered among the Baptists of three States, did not number
more than one hundred and fifty persons; but notwithstanding
this feeble support, upon investigation he was acquitted
of the charge made against him. Opposition to him
increased in the Redstone Association, and some of the
preachers determined to manufacture a sentiment that would
thrust him out when the association should meet in September,
1823. In pursuance of this purpose certain influential
men canvassed all the churches and secured the appointment
of messengers who were in sympathy with themselves in
opposition to Mr. Campbell; and when the association met
all things were in readiness to exclude the author of the
&ldquo;Sermon on the Law&rdquo; from the fellowship of the association.
But to the astonishment and chagrin of the plotters,
when the letter from the Brush Run Church was read, Mr.
Campbell, though present, was not mentioned as a messenger.
This cooled the ardor of his enemies who had
hoped to close Baptist ears against him by a decree of excommunication,
and crush his influence generally by putting
him in the discreditable position of one expelled from the
association. A motion being made to invite him to a seat
in the body, his enemies opposed it, and demanded to know
why he had not been sent as a messenger. After much discussion
Mr. Campbell relieved the situation by stating that
the church of which he was then a member did not belong
to the Redstone Association. In describing the chagrin
of his enemies when this announcement was made, Mr.
Campbell says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never did hunters, on seeing the game unexpectedly escape
from their toils at the moment when its capture was sure, glare
upon each other a more mortifying disappointment than that
indicated by my pursuers at that instant, on hearing that I was
out of their bailiwick, and consequently out of their jurisdiction.
A solemn stillness ensued, and for a time all parties seemed to
have nothing to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Foreseeing the storm that was gathering, and learning,
just a few weeks before the time for the association to convene,
the plans that were being so industriously laid to exclude
him from the association, he determined to defeat the
project in a way which his enemies little expected, but which
was in strict accordance with Baptist usage. As he had
been frequently solicited by Adomson Bently to leave the
Redstone Association and unite with the Mahoning, and as
a number of the members of the Brush Run Church lived in
Wellsburg and vicinity, he decided this was an opportune
time to form a separate congregation in which he would
have his membership, and which might afterward unite with
the Mahoning Association. He announced, therefore, to
the church at Brush Run that he desired from them letters
of dismission for himself and some thirty other members
in order to constitute a church at Wellsburg. This request
was granted and a congregation was at once formed in the
town of Wellsburg, and continued to assemble regularly ever
afterward in the house which had been previously erected
for that purpose. Thus were the unrighteous attempts of
wicked men defeated.</p>
<h4 id="c75">A WIDER FIELD</h4>
<p>Shortly before the events already mentioned, Mr.
Campbell was very unexpectedly drawn into a discussion
with John Walker, a minister of the Seceder Presbyterian
Church. It came about in this way: The jealousy of rival
religious parties at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, led to a controversy
between Mr. Walker and Mr. Birch, a Baptist preacher,
which ended in a challenge by Mr. Walker to meet any
Baptist preacher of good standing in the public discussion
of the question of baptism. The high opinion entertained
throughout that region for Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s ability led to his
selection as the most suitable champion of the Baptist cause.
Owing to the circumstances under which he was placed, he
did not give an immediate answer. In the meantime Mr.
Birch renewed the appeal, and finally made it more urgent
by stating that it was the unanimous wish of all the Baptist
churches throughout that region that he should be their representative
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
in the discussion. Being thus called upon by
the church, and urged by personal friends, he could no
longer refuse to yield to his own convictions of public duty.</p>
<p>His hesitancy was not due to his own disinclination, but
in deference to his father, who did not regard &ldquo;public debates
the proper method of proceeding in contending for the
faith once delivered to the saints.&rdquo; He, however, finally
succeeded in convincing his father that, however much the
usual unprofitable debates upon human theories were to be
deplored and avoided, no objection could lie against a public
defense of revealed truth, for which the Scriptures afforded
abundant precedent. Having gained this point with his
father, he finally informed Mr. Birch of his willingness to
enter the discussion.</p>
<p>All preliminaries having been arranged, the discussion
began on Monday morning, June 19, 1820, at Mount
Pleasant, Ohio. It was attended by a large concourse of
people and created great interest. Mr. Walker&rsquo;s first speech
was very brief, and as it gives the gist of his whole contention
throughout the debate, I will give it in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My friends, I do not intend to speak long at one
time, perhaps not more than five or ten minutes, and
will, therefore, come to the point at once: I maintain
that baptism came into the room of circumcision; that
the covenant on which the Jewish Church was built,
and to which circumcision is the seal, is the same with
the covenant on which the Christian Church is built,
and to which baptism is the seal; that the Jews and
the Christians are the same body politic under the
same lawgiver and husband; hence the Jews were
called the congregation of the Lord; and the bridegroom
of the church says, &ldquo;My love, my undefiled is
one&rdquo;&mdash;consequently the infants of believers have a
right to baptism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to this speech Mr. Campbell said that the
pedobaptists acted as if they did not themselves believe infant
baptism to be true, since, in point of fact, they did not
put baptism in the room of circumcision, as they did not
confine it to males only and extend it to servants as well
as to children, perform it on the eighth day, etc.; and then
proceeded to point out various differences between the two
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
institutions which rendered the supposed substitution of the
one for the other impossible. Among these he particularizes
the fact that circumcision required only carnal descent from
Abraham, but that baptism demanded faith in Christ as its
indispensable prerequisite; and that baptism differed from
circumcision in the nature of the blessings it conveyed,
which were spiritual and not temporal: &ldquo;Baptism is connected
with the promise of the remission of sins and the
gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This utterance is his first public
recognition of the importance of baptism. While he then
distinctly perceived and asserted a scriptural connection between
baptism and remission of sins, he seems at this time to
have viewed it only in the light of an argument and to have
but a faint conception of its great practical importance in
the economy of grace.</p>
<p>As the discussion proceeded, all recognized that he was
an invincible defender of what he believed the Scriptures
taught. His whole training had fitted him for such an
arena. His liberal education, his extensive reading, his wonderful
memory, his faultless diction, his remarkable self-control,
sustained as they were by deep earnestness of purpose,
gave him at once a vantage ground which he never relinquished.
But such was the originality of his method in
handling the truth and his freedom from the accepted terms
of the theological schools that even the victory, which was
universally admitted to be with him, was not accepted by
many of the Baptists as an unmixed blessing. The opportunities
and issues of the debate were such as to convince
Mr. Campbell of its practical utility in disseminating the
truth and he gave the following challenge in his concluding
speech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I this day publish to all present that I feel disposed
to meet any pedobaptist minister of any denomination,
of good standing in his party, and I engage
to prove in a debate with him, either orally or with
the pen, that infant sprinkling is a human tradition
and injurious to the well-being of society, religious and
political.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a challenge was well calculated to make a deep impression
on all who heard it, and this was what he designed
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
it to do. In the frankness of his independent spirit he, from
that time forward, held himself in readiness to meet in public
discussion any worthy champion who might rise in opposition
to the truths he taught, or in defense of popular religious
error.</p>
<p>The effect of this discussion, however, was to aid Mr.
Campbell&rsquo;s growing reputation. His fame was widely extended
by the publication of the debate, which was read by
thousands, and began soon to produce results far beyond
his fondest hopes. The printed debate circulated very
widely among the Baptists, who felt that they had the best
of the argument. While some Baptists &ldquo;remained extremely
dubious in regard to the orthodoxy of their champion,&rdquo;
others took grateful pride in him, and felt, as one Baptist
declared, that &ldquo;he had done more for the Baptists in the
West than any other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The printing and circulation of the debate opened the
eyes of Mr. Campbell to the power and usefulness of the
press. From that time forward he cherished the hope that
he might do something upon a more extended scale to rouse
the people from their spiritual lethargy. Step by step he
had been brought to an eminence from which he could survey
the wide field in which he was destined to labor, and
he now nerved himself for the undertaking. After maturing
his plans, he conferred with his father and others concerning
the advisability of issuing a monthly publication in the
interest of religious truth. They heartily approved his plan,
and he issued in the spring of 1823 a prospectus for the
work which he proposed to call &ldquo;The Christian Baptist.&rdquo;
In this prospectus the nature and objects of the publication
were candidly and clearly stated, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Christian Baptist&rdquo; shall espouse the cause of no
religious sect, excepting that ancient sect &ldquo;called Christians
first at Antioch.&rdquo; Its sole object shall be the eviction of the
truth and the exposing of error in doctrine and practice. The
editor, acknowledging no standard of religious faith or works
other than the Old and New Testament, and the latter as the
only standard of the religion of Jesus Christ, will, intentionally
at least, oppose nothing which it contains, and recommend
nothing which it does not enjoin. Having no worldly
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
interest at stake from the adoption or reprobation of any
articles of faith or religious practice, having no gift nor religious
emolument to blind his eyes or to pervert his judgment,
he hopes to manifest that he is an impartial advocate of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He dedicated the work &ldquo;to all those, without distinction,
who acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments
to be a true revelation from God, and the New Testament
as containing the religion of Jesus Christ; who, willing
to have all religious tenets and practices tried by the
divine Word, and who, feeling themselves in duty bound
to search the Scripture for themselves in all matters of
religion, are disposed to reject all doctrine and commandments
of men, and to obey the truth, holding fast the faith
once delivered to the saints.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c76"><span class="sc">The Campbell-McCalla Discussion</span></h4>
<p>While making preparations to issue The Christian Baptist,
he received a letter from Mr. McCalla, a Presbyterian
preacher of Augusta, Ky., accepting his challenge given at
the conclusion of the Walker debate. Mr. McCalla had
been a lawyer and had gained a high reputation among the
Presbyterians for his polemical powers. It was therefore
greatly desired by his friends and the pedobaptists of the
community that he should have an opportunity to retrieve,
if possible, the injury which had been done to their cause
by the generally-admitted failure of Mr. Walker. After
having ascertained his standing, Mr. Campbell agreed to
meet him, and arrangements were made for the discussion
to take place at Washington, Ky., beginning October 15,
1823. As the Ohio River was too low for navigation at
the time, Mr. Campbell made the entire distance of about
three hundred miles on horseback.</p>
<p>Here, as in his former discussion, the entire bearing of
the baptismal question was carefully canvassed. Each controverted
point was hotly contested in the presence of a vast
assemblage, which had been drawn together by Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s
reputation and their own interest in the question at
issue. During this discussion, which continued seven days,
in addition to his defense of the scriptural act and subject
of baptism, the design and importance were set forth and
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
examined in a systematic form, and with such critical ability
as to astonish his hearers. In the discussion with Walker
he barely touched the design of baptism, but either during
that debate or while transcribing it for publication, an impression
was made on his mind that it had a very important
meaning and that it was in some way connected with remission
of sins, but he was so engaged in other matters that it
passed out of his mind till he received the challenge to meet
McCalla in debate, when he resolved to settle its true import
before he ever debated the subject again. In the investigation,
he examined the New Testament with great care
and discussed the subject with his father for several months,
and formed his conclusion after thorough examination and
reflection, and after he saw that it was the way marked out
by the Holy Spirit he had no hesitancy, on the second day
of the debate with McCalla, in saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our third argument is deduced from the design or import
of baptism. On this topic of argument we shall be as full as
possible, because of its great importance, and because perhaps
neither Baptists nor Pedobaptists sufficiently appreciate
it. I will first merely refer to the oracles of God, which
show that baptism is an ordinance of the greatest importance
and of momentous significance. Never was there an ordinance
of so great import or design. It is to be but once administered.
We are to pray often, praise often, show forth the Lord&rsquo;s
death often, commemorate his resurrection every week, but
we are to be baptized but once. Its great significance can
be seen from the following testimonies: The Lord saith, &ldquo;He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16).
He does not say, &ldquo;He that believeth and keeps my commandments
shall be saved,&rdquo; but he saith, &ldquo;He that believeth and
is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; He placeth baptism on the right
hand of faith. Again, he tells Nicodemus that &ldquo;unless a man
be born of water and of the Spirit he can not enter into the
kingdom of God.&rdquo; Peter, on the day of Pentecost, places baptism
in the same exalted place. &ldquo;Repent,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and be
baptized, every one of you, for the remission of sins&rdquo; (Acts
2:38). Ananias saith to Paul, &ldquo;Arise and be baptized and
wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts
22:16). Paul saith to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Ye were once fornicators,
idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, thieves, covetous,
drunkards, rioters, extortioners, but ye are washed in the name
of the Lord Jesus,&rdquo; doubtless referring to their baptism. He
tells Titus, &ldquo;God our Father saved us by the washing of
regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Titus 3:5).
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
See again its dignified importance. Peter finishes the grand
climax in praise of baptism: &ldquo;Baptism doth now also save
us ... by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo;
(I Peter 3:21).</p>
<p>It was this view of baptism misapplied that originated
infant baptism. The first errorists on this subject argued that
if baptism was so necessary for the remission of sins, it should
be administered to infants, whom they represented as in great
need of it on account of their &ldquo;original sin.&rdquo; Affectionate
parents, believing their children to be guilty of &ldquo;original sin,&rdquo;
were easily persuaded to have them baptized for the remission
of &ldquo;original sin,&rdquo; not for washing away sins actually committed.
Faith in Christ is necessary to forgiveness of sins,
therefore baptism without faith is an unmeaning ceremony.</p>
<p>Our argument from this topic is, that baptism being ordained
to be to a believer a formal and personal remission of
all his sins, can not be administered unto an infant without
the gravest perversion and abuse of the nature and import
of this ordinance. Indeed, why should an infant that never
sinned&mdash;that, as Calvinists say, is guilty only of &ldquo;original sin,&rdquo;
which is a unit&mdash;be baptized for the remission of sins?
(&ldquo;Campbell-McCalla Debate,&rdquo; pages 116, 117, 136.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a number of years prior to the debate Mr. McCalla
had taken great delight in assailing the distinctive tenets of
the Baptists, and gave them no little annoyance. As the
debate progressed his defeat became more and more manifest
and raised Mr. Campbell to great popularity among
them; but as it was not his intention to seek popularity
among them by catering to their admiration, by fostering
their favorite but defective views of the Gospel and its
institutions, he deemed it wise on the evening of the fifth
day of the debate to candidly inform the principal Baptist
preachers present of the exact position which he occupied.
Being assembled in a room where he had called them together,
he introduced himself fully to their acquaintance in
the following manner, as related by himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, I fear that if you knew me better you would
esteem and love me less. For let me tell you that I have almost
as much against you Baptists as I have against the Presbyterians.
They err in one thing and you in another; and you are
each nearly equidistant from original apostolic Christianity.&rdquo;
I paused; and such a silence as ensued, accompanied by a piercing
look from all sides of the room, I seldom before witnessed.
Elder Vardeman at length broke the silence by saying: &ldquo;Well,
sir, we want to know our errors or your heterodoxy. Do let
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
us hear it. Keep nothing back.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;I know not
where to begin; nor am I in health and vigor after the toils
of the day to undertake so heavy a task; but I am commencing
a publication called The Christian Baptist, to be devoted to
all such matters, a few copies of which are in my portmanteau,
and, with your permission, I will read you a few specimens of
my heterodoxy.&rdquo; They all said: &ldquo;Let us hear&mdash;let us hear
the worst error you have against us.&rdquo; I went upstairs and
unwrapped the first three numbers of the Christian Baptist
that ever saw the light in Kentucky. I had just ten copies
of the first three numbers. I carried them into the parlor and
read a sample, the first essay on the clergy&mdash;so much of it as
respected the &ldquo;call to the ministry&rdquo; as then taught in the
&ldquo;kingdom of the clergy,&rdquo; and especially among the Baptists.
This was the first essay ever read from it in Kentucky. After
a sigh and a long silence, Elder Vardeman said: &ldquo;Is that your
worst error, your chief heterodoxy? I do not care so much
about that, as you admit that we have a providential call,
without a voice from heaven or a special visit from some angel
or spirit. If you have anything worse, for my part I wish to
hear it.&rdquo; The cry was, &ldquo;Let us hear something more.&rdquo; On
turning to and fro, I read an article on &ldquo;Modern Missionaries.&rdquo;
This, with the &ldquo;Capital Mistake of Modern Missionaries,&rdquo;
finished my reading for the evening. On closing this essay,
Elder Vardeman said: I am not so great a missionary man
as to fall out with you on that subject. I must hear more
before I condemn or approve.&rdquo; I then distributed my ten
copies among the ten most distinguished and advanced elders
in the room, requesting them to read these numbers during the
recess of the debate, and to communicate freely to me their
objections. We separated. So the matter ended at that time.
(&ldquo;Memoirs of A. Campbell,&rdquo; Vol. II, page 88.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the close of the debate the Baptist preachers were
so much pleased with the results, and so tolerant of what
they found in the &ldquo;Christian Baptist,&rdquo; that they requested
Mr. Campbell to furnish them with the printed proposals
for its publication, in order to extend its circulation, and
urged him to make an immediate tour through the State.</p>
<p>Previous engagements prevented, and he could only
comply with their wishes so far as to visit Bryan&rsquo;s Station,
Mayslick, and Lexington; promising, if possible, to make a
more extended tour through the State the following year.</p>
<p>As Mr. McCalla&rsquo;s character for ability was well established
and equally well sustained by his Presbyterian brethren,
the results of the discussion were less damaging to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
reputation than to the cause which he advocated, which to
this day has never recovered from the withering defeat
which it then suffered. But Mr. McCalla labored for some
time after the debate to change public sentiment by preaching
on the subjects discussed in various parts of Kentucky,
endeavoring at the same time to prejudice the minds of the
people in advance against the report of the debate which
Mr. Campbell was soon to publish.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell was fully satisfied with his part in the
discussion, and was now thoroughly satisfied that debates
were a great means of reaching the people with the truth,
for he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public discussion, is, we are convinced, one of the best
means of propagating the truth and of exposing error in doctrine
or practice. We now reap the benefits of public debates
of former times, and we have witnessed the beneficial results
of those in our own time. And we are fully persuaded that
a week&rsquo;s debating is worth a year&rsquo;s preaching, such as we
generally have, for the purpose of disseminating truth and
putting error out of countenance. There is nothing like meeting
face to face in the presence of many witnesses and &ldquo;talking
the matter over&rdquo;; and the man that can not govern his spirit in
the midst of opposition and contradiction is a poor Christian
indeed. (Christian Baptist, Vol. 1, page 189.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c77">VISITS THE KENTUCKY BAPTISTS</h4>
<p>The debate was attended by great crowds of people from
far and near. Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s reputation as one of the
first pulpit orators of the day was fully established; and
wherever he could be induced to speak he was met by throngs
of hearers. His most important reception on this trip was
at Lexington, where he spoke in the Baptist meetinghouse,
of which Dr. Fishback was minister. At the hour for the
meeting the house was crowded to its utmost capacity.
When Mr. Campbell rose he was not able to stand erect
during the delivery of his discourse. &ldquo;This was based on
the first chapter of Hebrews, and led him to dwell upon the
divine glory of the Son of God&mdash;a theme on which he was
almost surpassingly eloquent. It lasted two hours, during
which the audience sat in rapt attention.&rdquo; He made a very
profound impression on the entire audience. They recognized
in him the mightiest intellect that had ever visited their
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
city. The freshness of his thoughts, the extent and accuracy
of his Biblical knowledge and his grand generalizations of
the wonderful fact of redemption opened up trains of
reflection wholly new, and presented the subject of Christianity
in a form so simple and yet so comprehensive as
to fill every one with admiration; so that from this time
forward Mr. Campbell was esteemed by the people of
Kentucky as great among the greatest of her public men,
and without a rival in the department to which he had
devoted his powers.</p>
<p>Immediately after the close of the debate with Mr.
McCalla, Mr. Campbell made preparations for its publication.
This was done from his own notes and those taken
by Sydney Rigdon during the debate, and notwithstanding
Mr. McCalla&rsquo;s effort to discredit it before its appearance, its
general accuracy was attested by those who heard the discussion.
Its publication and circulation proved the severest
blow that pedobaptism ever received.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1824 Mr. Campbell made his promised
visit to Kentucky, visiting a large portion of the State,
addressing everywhere large audiences, and extending his
acquaintance and influence with the Baptists. This more
intimate acquaintance led him to esteem them very highly,
and to regard them as much nearer the apostolic model than
any other of the denominations with which he had formed
acquaintance, and he felt that it would not be difficult to
eliminate from the Baptist churches such erroneous theories
and usages as had gained currency among them. With
these convictions in mind, he now visited the Baptists in
Kentucky, to impart to them, as well as to the community
at large, those clearer views of the Gospel to which he had
been led by diligent and prayerful study of the Bible. These
he had, to some extent, already presented through the pages
of The Christian Baptist, which, since the debate, had been
read throughout Kentucky with interest and had produced
intense excitement among the churches. &ldquo;Some individuals
were favorably impressed with the plea for reform; others
remained in perplexity and doubt, while not a few were disposed
to cling tenaciously to their cherished opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h3 id="c78">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="h3line2">JOHN SMITH</span></h3>
<p>Among the Baptist preachers whom Mr. Campbell met
on this visit was John Smith, who, on account of the prominent
part he afterwards had in presenting apostolic Christianity
to the people, deserves more than a passing notice.
He was born October 15, 1784, in a log cabin in East
Tennessee, whither his parents had moved a short time
before his birth on account of religious persecution. His
father and mother had espoused the Baptist faith. But as
Virginia, at that time, had an established form of religion,
the Episcopal, Baptists were a despised, hunted, persecuted
people. They were described by their persecutors as
&ldquo;schismatical persons, so averse to the established religion,
and so filled with new-fangled conceits of their heretical inventions,
as to refuse to have their children baptized.&rdquo; To
escape from this galling oppression and to secure religious
privileges which were so dear to him, George Smith took
his little flock into the wilderness, seeking mercy at the
hands of the savage tribes of the forest, which was not
accorded him by the savage spirit of religious intolerance.
In his new home he was at least free to work out the great
problem of his own destiny in harmony with &ldquo;the dictates
of conscience&rdquo; and the leadings of Providence. He was
humble-minded and earnestly pious. He held firmly every
dogma of the Philadelphia Confession of Faith as it was
expounded in his day. &ldquo;He conscientiously sought, too,
to impress his own severe faith on the minds of his children.
To labor for their daily bread and to wait, with
humbleness of heart, for the Holy Ghost, were the two
great commandments on which hung all his precepts and
admonitions. He exhorted them to seek after God, if,
haply, they might find him; yet to esteem themselves dead
and to abide the good time when, unless predestinated to
eternal wrath, the mysterious Spirit would give them life
and open their eyes to the beauties of the Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>When John was in his twelfth year the migratory spirit
again seized George Smith, who determined to plunge into
the wilderness once more, with a view of securing cheap
lands and providing for the future of his growing family.
Having sold his Tennessee farm, he set out, in the autumn
of 1795, accompanied by John and an older brother, on the
trail that led across the Cumberland Mountains in the unsettled
territory of Kentucky, in search of a &ldquo;goodly spot
where he might build a cabin, plant a patch of corn, and
prepare as well as he could for the family&rdquo; that was to join
him in the coming summer.</p>
<p>In the new home the life of the boy continued its developments
along such lines as its rude surroundings stimulated.
Of work there was plenty, and from his daily tasks he never
shrank. Of opportunity for intellectual development there
was none, and the thirst of the ambitious youth was unquenched.
At this period John Smith&rsquo;s spiritual nature
gave promise of being as untamed as the forest that surrounded
his home. Unhallowed sports crept into the backwoods.
Sunday horse races and card-playing became the
pastime of the young men. For the latter John had a fondness,
and would creep away on Sundays to spend the day
with idle companions in his favorite game; but the grief and
patience of the father at last touched his heart, and he
threw away his cards, saying, &ldquo;It is wrong to distress so
good a father as ours; it is a sin and a shame!&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c79">SOUL STRUGGLES</h4>
<p>This proved to be the turning point in the young man&rsquo;s
career, and with it came the question of religion demanding
his consideration. Indeed the subject had been kept before
him in some form from his earliest recollection. But the
doctrine taught at that time was not very attractive to young
hearts. Calvinism in its severest type was prevalent. It
taught a &ldquo;hell of the most appalling type, into which even
little children might be cast; an unalterable destiny for every
one, regardless of his conduct or his creed, as God might
have chosen him for heaven or doomed him to hell before
he was born; a dread uncertainty that rested on his fate;
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
his utter inability to understand the Scriptures, to believe
or repent, to love God or to obey him, until endued with
power from on high; the necessity of some supernatural
sign or sensation, some miraculous voice or vision, as an
evidence of pardon and acceptance with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was natural that John should imbibe the spirit of his
father&rsquo;s creed and for him to expect, should he be among
the elect, that some visible or audible manifestation of divine
approval should be given him. The great revival which
swept the country in the beginning years of the nineteenth
century was at its height as he began seriously to think upon
the subject of religion. It was the theme he heard discussed
on every hand, and he determined to investigate it as far as
his limited resources would permit. Failing to find the
way to assured salvation, he at last appealed to a Baptist
preacher, Isaac Denton, a friend of the family, for light
upon the subject which was beginning to agitate his mind.
According to the prevailing notion, conversion was a change
of a mysterious nature wrought out in the soul by supernatural
agency. This change young Smith now most sincerely
desired to experience. With this in mind the following
conversation took place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smith&mdash;What must I do in order to have this change of
which you speak?</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;Nothing, John; God&rsquo;s grace is sovereign and unconditional.
If you are his sheep you will be called, and you
will hear his voice and follow him.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;But when, Mr. Denton, will the Lord call?</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;In his own good time, John. He has worked out
your whole life, and determined your destiny according to his
own wise, but hidden and eternal, purpose.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;How then may I know whether I am one of his
sheep or not?</p>
<p>Benton&mdash;You will know it by your change when it comes;
till then you can only wait on the Lord and hope.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;If I am left to perish I know it will be on account
of my sins; but if I should be saved, will it not be on account
of my goodness?</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;The Lord sees no goodness in you, John. If you
are ever brought to life, it will be solely because it was his
good pleasure to choose you before the foundation of the world,
and that, too, without any reference to your character or works
foreseen by him. True, if you should be lost, if you perish,
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
it will be on account of your sins, and to the praise of his
glorious justice.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;My destiny, you say, is fixed and I can not change
it. I need not, then, give myself any concern; I have nothing
to do.</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;Ah, great is the mystery of godliness. There is
something for you to do.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;What is it, Mr. Denton?</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;You must pray, pray, pray in the dust and ashes
to the Lord.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;Pray for what, sir?</p>
<p>Denton&mdash;That the blinding scales may fall from your eyes,
and that you may see and feel what you really are in the sight
of God; for you are yet in the gall of bitterness and the bonds
of iniquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not strange that a young man with keen intellect
of John Smith should have turned from such instruction,
saying, &ldquo;Since my destiny is fixed and I can not change it,
I need not, then, give myself any concern. I have nothing
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his heart was not to be stifled by the forbidding
theology. While stoutly for a season he maintained his
unbelief, his position was not satisfactory to himself, and
he resolved at last to examine the subject in the light of the
Scriptures. Though failing to find proof of the doctrines
taught, he became convinced of his duty to be a Christian,
and, knowing no way to approach to Christ, he began earnestly
and persistently to seek religion after the manner of
the times. The illness and death of his venerable father in
the spring of 1804, deepened his interest in personal salvation,
and from that time through many weary months he
sought for assurance of saving grace. In his fruitless
search his agony was indescribable.</p>
<p>He had been taught that an indispensable step to salvation
was to feel himself the greatest of sinners. This he
desired to do, and then despaired of salvation, simply because
he could not feel that he was &ldquo;too wicked to be saved.&rdquo;
A gloomy cloud overshadowed his sunny temper. His
nights were sleepless and his days filled with torment. In
vain he prostrated himself alone in the forest and prayed
for the blessed assurance of his pardon. Finally, after a
night spent in agonizing prayer, his heart seemed to throw
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
off its burden, and he was happy. Returning home and
relating his experience to his brother William, the latter
replied with joy, &ldquo;You are converted, John, at last.&rdquo; He
went to a meeting, expecting to offer himself for membership,
but the weird experience of others sent him away in
sorrow and disgust. His mind was again beclouded by
doubts and despair, and he prayed the Lord to keep his
poor heart from error and to lead him by the right way
into the everlasting kingdom.</p>
<p>Religious friends who had watched with solicitude the
long and painful struggle of the young man believed that
a work of grace had already been wrought in his heart, and
urged him to relate the facts before the congregation. This
he did on December 26, 1804, giving a plain statement of
his religious struggles, and though his experience was lacking
in the marvelous element which characterized the conversion
of that time, the congregation unanimously voted
him the subject of a work of grace. The next day he was
baptized, and at once entered into the active service of the
Master to find in doing the peace he had failed to receive
in seeking.</p>
<h4 id="c80">DESIRES TO PREACH</h4>
<p>No sooner had John Smith been received into the Baptist
Church than he became exceedingly anxious to preach
the unsearchable riches of Christ. But two obstacles rose
before him which seemed an insurmountable barrier to the
realization of his desires. One was his ignorance. In his
brief term of schooling he had barely learned to read and
his surroundings and occupation had left him without further
means of self-improvement, as he looked with yearning
heart toward the ministry, he &ldquo;wept at the thought that
he was now a man without an education.&rdquo; No less was
the hindrance which the popular sentiment of the day threw
across his pathway. It was regarded as an almost unpardonable
act of presumption to stand before the people as
an expounder of the Scriptures without a supernatural call,
and yet he was without evidence of such a call to preach the
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
gospel. No voice spoke to his listening ear. No answer
came to his earnest prayer. No sign met his expectant
vision.</p>
<p>In the face of these obstacles the way seemed completely
blocked, so nothing remained for him to do but to continue
in his labors on the farm. At last circumstances opened
up before him for larger usefulness for God. His widely
scattered neighbors were pious people, and, in the absence
of churches and ministers, often gathered at night after a
day of toil, in each other&rsquo;s cabins, to sing and pray, and
talk about their religious interests. At these meetings he
was present, when circumstances would permit, and his
native ability, gave him pre-eminence among them. As they
met from house to house they often constrained him to lead in
prayer. In these religious meetings his confidence increased,
his heart warmed, and he greatly desired to enter into more
active service. But still he waited for some audible call
which should assure him of the Lord&rsquo;s will. His brethren
urged that when God gave man a talent, he gives the
right to use it. He was finally persuaded to lay aside his
scruples, and at the prayer meeting he consented to make a
short talk. The appointment was made, the people came
together, filling the house to its utmost capacity, the light
from the fire fell full upon his face as he arose and stood
near the table, but as he looked into the faces of his neighbors,
he was seized with stage fright, and forgot everything
he had hoped to say. He fled from the house and sought the
darkness outside, but in his hurried flight he stumbled and
fell to the ground. As he arose his mind cleared, and he
returned and delivered a thrilling address, and from that
time he continued in his humble way to lead those who were
as sheep without a shepherd.</p>
<p>He waited anxiously for the call, but it came not. But
the call from his brethren was so strong that he continued
to exercise the gift of exhortation, with increasing desire
to devote his life to the work of proclaiming the Gospel to
his fellowmen. In deference to the judgment of his brethren,
who urged him to lay aside all scruples and become their
preacher, he at last consented to be ordained, and entered
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
at once upon the duties of his new calling, while continuing
to provide for his family by his labors on the farm. He
was marvelously endowed for the work of a pioneer
preacher. &ldquo;His well-toned voice and earnest manner, his
fine common sense and unaffected piety, rendered him pre-eminently
popular as a speaker; his genial humor, too, threw
its sunny influence on all around him and made him the
delight of every fireside.&rdquo; As his reputation spread flattering
offers came to him from the more favored portions of
Kentucky, through which he was induced to travel on a
preaching tour. Wealthy congregations, pleased with his
originality and genius, offered him what was then regarded
as a handsome salary to labor with them. But, conscious
of his lack of education and culture, he declined these offers,
while his soul, for the time lifted up with pride, planned
ambitiously for the future.</p>
<h4 id="c81">TERRIBLE CALAMITY</h4>
<p>Just here occurred the saddest episode of his life. The
South was being opened up, and many were drawn thither
by what seemed to be a most promising picture. He sold
his farm and stock for $1,500, with which he hoped to enter
ten thousand acres of land, which, with the advance in price,
he was sure would make him a wealthy man. In the fall
of 1814, he located his family in a log hut, in what is now
Madison County, Alabama, and went out to select his land.
During his absence, in one awful night, his hopes and happiness
were dashed to pieces. The house which contained
his possessions and wife and children, was burned to the
ground, and two of his children and all his money were
consumed in the flames of that awful night. His poor wife
escaped, only to die of a broken heart and be buried with
the ashes of her children. The husband, though a strong
man, was so shocked that he was at last stricken with fever,
and for weeks lingered near the grave. But he finally
recovered, and with a sad heart, he retraced his steps, empty-handed
and alone, to the old home in Kentucky.</p>
<h4 id="c82">PREACHES AT CRAB ORCHARD</h4>
<p>Immediately after his return to Kentucky he began
preaching again; but he was from that time harassed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
doctrinal difficulties which gave him no rest until he turned
from his creed to the Bible in its primitive simplicity. His
appearance, as he joined his brethren in the meeting of the
Baptist Association, shortly after his return, is thus described
by his biographer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He reached Crab Orchard on Saturday, with the dust of
the journey thick upon him. He wore a pair of homespun
cotton pantaloons, striped with coperas&mdash;loose enough, but far
too short for him&mdash;and a cotton coat, once checked with blue
and white, but now of undistinguishable colors; these had
been given him in Alabama. His shapeless hat was streaked
with sweat and dust. His socks, too large for his shrunken
ankles, hung down upon his worn shoes. His shirt was coarse
and dirty and unbuttoned at the neck; his white cravat was
in the coffin with his wife. (Life of John Smith, page 96.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the exterior of this vessel was rough, within it was
garnished and adorned with all the graces of truth. He
was pressed upon to speak on the occasion. He lifted his
head and sat erect, he arose, and, with firm step, walked to
the stand and stood up before the people. As he looked
around upon them his eyes kindled and his spirit was stirred
within him. The multitude stared curiously for a moment
at the uncouth figure before them. Some laughed outright,
while others were withdrawn from the assembly.
His first work was to stop them. Raising his voice so that
all could hear, he said: &ldquo;Stay, friends, and hear what the
Great Augustine said. Augustine wished to see three things
before he died: Rome in her glory, Paul on Mars&rsquo; Hill,
and Jesus in the flesh.&rdquo; A few sat down, but many moved
on.</p>
<p>In louder tones he cried: &ldquo;Will you not stay and see
what the great Cato said. Cato repented of three things
before his death: First that he had ever spent an idle day;
second, that he had ever gone on a voyage by water when
he might have made the same journey by land; and, third,
that he had ever told the secrets of his bosom to a woman.&rdquo;
Many more were seated.</p>
<p>But he continued: &ldquo;Come, friends, and hear what the
great Thales thanked the gods for. He thanked the gods
for three things: First, that he was endowed with reason,
and was not a brute; second, that he as a Greek, and not a
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
barbarian; and third, that he was a man, and not a woman.&rdquo;
By this time all were seated and the sermon began.</p>
<p>His theme was redemption. His analysis was threefold:
(1) Redemption as conceived; (2) Redemption as
applied; (3) Redemption as completed. He seemed inspired
for the occasion. His voice like a trumpet reached
and thrilled the most distant hearer, and his thought swept
the audience like the storm sweeps the sea. The people
crowded closer to hear him, and some who could find neither
sitting nor standing room, climbed the trees, so that even
the forest swayed to and fro as if under the magic spell
in the third division, and portrayed the final glory of the
redeemed, every heart was filled with emotion, every eye
as weeping, every face was radiant with hope, and at the
close one loud &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; ascended to the heavens.</p>
<p>In the course of time he again married, choosing as a
companion a sensible and consecrated woman who lived in
the neighborhood where he ministered, and who cheerfully
joined him in all his plans for the betterment of human
society.</p>
<h4 id="c83">THE CHRISTIAN BAPTIST</h4>
<p>Though preaching the doctrine of the Philadelphia Confession
of Faith, he now found himself ill at ease. The
strange inconsistency of his position embarrassed him. Why
urge sinners to repent if they were already safe, and if
among the non-elect they could not repent. As the situation
flashed upon him in the midst of an impassioned exhortation,
he immediately closed his remarks and sat down,
saying: &ldquo;Brethren, something is wrong; I am in the dark&mdash;we
are all in the dark; but how to lead you to the light,
or to find the way myself, before God I know not.&rdquo; Retiring
on his knees he prayed that he would take God&rsquo;s Word
as his only guide, examine it carefully, and follow its teachings
wherever they might lead him. In the keeping of this
pledge he began anew to study the Bible. When his day&rsquo;s
work in the field was done, he would sit by his candle with
his Bible upon his knees, and often spend the whole night
in solemn meditation in his search for light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>It was while in this state of mind that the prospectus
of The Christian Baptist fell into his hands, and he read
it with profound interest. He ordered the paper sent to
him and induced others to subscribe for it. He hoped
that Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s discussion of scriptural themes would
greatly assist him in solving his own doctrinal difficulties.
The first numbers were read with great interest, and through
them light began to break along his darkened pathway. He
read each succeeding number with great care to ascertain to
which of the contending parties Mr. Campbell belonged,
and soon found himself in a realm of truth entirely beyond
the range of the popular systems. Among other things
that specially appealed to him was the following from the
trenchant pen of Mr. Campbell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have no system of our own, nor of others, to substitute
in lieu of the reigning systems. We only aim at substituting
the New Testament in lieu of every creed in existence;
whether Mohametan, Pagan, Jewish or Presbyterian.
We wish to call Christians to consider that Jesus Christ has
made them kings and priests to God. We neither advocate
Calvinism, Arminianism, Arianism, Socinianism, Trinitarianism,
Unitarianism, Deism, or Sectarianism, but New Testamentism.
We wish, we cordially wish, to take the New Testament
out of the abuses of the clergy, and put it into the hands
of the people. (Christian Baptist, Vol. 1, page 90.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c84">FETTERS CAST OFF</h4>
<p>So thorough did these views accord with his that he
determined at the first opportunity to meet Mr. Campbell
and learn from him by personal interview more of the new
order that he was advocating. During his visit to Kentucky
in 1824, to which I have already referred, the opportunity
presented itself. Mr. Campbell was to speak at Flemingsburg,
and Smith rode twenty miles on horseback that he
might see and hear him. He reached the town on the day
that Mr. Campbell was to preach. Shortly after his arrival
he met William Vaughn, a Baptist preacher, with whom
he was well acquainted, when the following conversation
took place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;Brother John, have you met Bro. Campbell yet?</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;No, sir, I have not. Have you seen him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;Why, I have been with him for eight days and
nights, through Mason and Bracken counties, and have heard
him every day.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;Do, then, tell me what his views are on doctrinal
points. Is he a Calvinist or an Arminian, or Arian, or a Trinitarian?</p>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;I do not know. He has nothing to do with any
of these things.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;Well, I can tell when I hear him just what he is.</p>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;How?</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;If a man of sense and takes a position, even though
he should not run it out into any ism, I can do it for him, and
tell exactly where he would land. But tell me, Bro. Vaughn,
does he know anything about heartfelt religion?</p>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;Lord bless you, he is one of the most pious, godly
men that I was ever in company with in all my life.</p>
<p>Smith&mdash;But do you think he knows anything about a Christian
experience?</p>
<p>Vaughn&mdash;Bless you, he knows everything. Come, I want
to introduce you to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this meeting with Mr. Campbell he afterward said:
&ldquo;I then felt as if I wanted to sit down and look at him
for one hour, without hearing a word from any one. I
wanted to scan him who had been so much talked of, and
who had in <i>The Christian Baptist</i> and in his debates introduced
so many new thoughts.&rdquo; But the hour appointed
for the address had come, and they walked into the house
together. Smith was determined now to ascertain the
theory of religion to which he held, if, indeed, he held to
any; for he was still full of doubt and suspicion.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell read the fourth chapter of Galatians.
After giving a general outline of the whole epistle, he took
up the allegory of Sarah and Hagar, and in a simple, plain
and artless manner, leaning with one hand on his cane, he
delivered his discourse. &ldquo;He seemed,&rdquo; as Smith afterward
remarked, &ldquo;to move in a higher sphere or latitude than that
in which the isms of the day abounded.&rdquo; At the conclusion
of the services Smith remarked to Mr. Vaughn,
&ldquo;Is it not hard, Bro. Vaughn, to ride twenty miles, as I
have done, just to hear a man preach thirty minutes?&rdquo; &ldquo;You
are mistaken,&rdquo; said Mr. Vaughn; &ldquo;look at your watch, for
it certainly has been longer than that.&rdquo; He looked at his
watch, and, to his surprise, saw that the discourse had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
two hours and a half long. On discovering this he said,
&ldquo;I have never been more deceived. Two hours of my life
are gone, I know not how, though wide awake, too, all the
time!&rdquo; On being questioned as to whether he had ascertained
whether he was a Calvinist or an Arminian, he replied:
&ldquo;No, I know nothing about the man; but be he
saint or devil, he has thrown more light on that epistle, and
on the whole Scripture, than I have received in all the sermons
that I have ever heard before.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c85">RESOLVES TO PREACH THE SIMPLE GOSPEL</h4>
<p>For several days he accompanied Mr. Campbell from
place to place, an enraptured listener to every discourse, and
earnestly engaged him in conversation as they traveled along
the way or sat under some hospitable roof. At last his
mind cast off its fetters. The way hitherto so clouded
became plain, and he left the company of Mr. Campbell,
resolved henceforth to devote his life to preaching the simple
Gospel as exhibited in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The step was, as he had anticipated, attended with great
sacrifices. Old friends forsook him. He had always stood
high among his preaching brethren, but now he was regarded
with undisguised suspicion. Soon the storm gathered furiously
about him. At the annual meeting of the association
in which he held his membership charges were preferred
against him, among the most serious of which was that,
instead of the King James translation of the Scriptures, &ldquo;he
had on two or three occasions in public, and often in his
family, read from Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s translation.&rdquo; Without
being given an opportunity to defend himself, he was
placed under censure, and given a year in which to correct
his views and change his ways.</p>
<p>Returning to his home, the way for a time seemed to
close before him. The little farm was covered with a
heavy mortgage. The churches that had obligated themselves
to pay his debt in compensation of his services, now
refused to make further payment. Nothing apparently
remained but for him to cultivate his farm with his own
hands, and for a time to abandon the work of the ministry.
Taking his ax he went into the forest with the heroic purpose,
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
first to free himself from debt, and then to return
to the defense of the faith which he now felt to be the
teaching of the Word of God. But one day as he was
bending to his labors he thought of the cause that he loved,
and remembered that there was no one in all the land to
advocate it but himself. He also thought of the construction
that would be put on his silence by his enemies. He
dropped the ax, went to the house, and threw down his
coarse apron at the feet of his wife, exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nancy, I shall work no more! Get whom you please to
carry on the farm, but do not call on me! In all the land
there is not one soul to open his mouth in defense of the best
cause under the sun! I am determined, from this time forth,
to preach the Gospel, and leave the consequences to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the courage of his convictions, he immediately began
to preach the truth as he now felt it and saw it. No
personal consideration was allowed to interfere with the
course he had marked out for himself. His heroic wife
readily caught his spirit and as cheerfully accepted the
responsibilities of her new position&mdash;agreeing to take the
oversight of the farm, care for the family, and to relieve
him of every temporal care, while he should give himself
wholly to the ministry of the Word.</p>
<p>But from a course so radical and perilous his friends
earnestly sought to dissuade him. They argued: &ldquo;Your
more influential brethren will abandon you; you will get
nothing for your preaching; your debts will press you to
the earth, and your farm and house eventually given up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Conscience,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is an article that I have never yet
brought into the market; but should I offer it for sale, Montgomery
County, with all its lands and houses, would not be
enough to buy it, much less that farm of one hundred acres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he now went from house to house, and neighborhood,
to plant the cause of Christ, his zeal knew no bounds.
His heart was all aglow with his new-born knowledge of
the truth, and with tireless effort he sought to win men to
respect and obey the simple claims of the Gospel. So intense
was his desire that he scarcely allowed himself time
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
to eat and sleep. After a busy day he would often spend a
greater part of the night answering questions or meeting
objections which his public discourses had aroused, or in
helping some half-persuaded inquirer to a full acceptance
of the Gospel; often going the same hour of the night to
some near-by stream to administer baptism, when a surrender
had been made. Or, if at home, the burden that
was upon his heart, and his thirst for the knowledge of
the Word of God, would often interfere with his sleep, and
he would arise and light his candle at midnight &ldquo;to examine
some word or text not yet understood, and which, perhaps,
had confused him in his dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preaching of John Smith, so different from that of
the times, so far removed from the conventional forms,
and so new and strange in doctrine, at once awakened new
interest in languishing churches. Calls now came to him
from so many quarters that he seldom had an opportunity
to enjoy the fellowship of his family, to which he was
warmly attached. He endeavored, if possible, to visit his
home once a week; but this purpose he was not always able
to accomplish. &ldquo;He would tarry at some distant place,
preaching and baptizing till the week was nearly gone, and
then, dismissing the people at a late hour, ride hurriedly
through the darkness, sometimes through mud and cold and
tempest, in order to keep his promise with his wife. At
other times, when going from one part of the district to
another, he would pass along by his own house, but, too
much hurried to stop and rest, would linger a while at the
gate, and, gathering strength from her words of cheer, press
on to his distant appointment.&rdquo; On one occasion, as he
thus hurried from one appointment to another, he stopped at
home just long enough to change his soiled linen for clean.
As he was about to leave his wife remarked with a touch
of sadness in her tone, &ldquo;Is it not time that you were having
your washing done somewhere else? We have attended
to it for you a long time.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Nancy, I am pleased with
your way of doing things, and I do not wish to make any
change.&rdquo; After a kind good-bye to her and a few playful
words to the little ones, he passed on to meet the congregation
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
that would wait for him that day in some young
convert&rsquo;s house, or perhaps, in some hospitable grove.</p>
<p>The patient heroism of faith finds few better illustrations
than in the wife of this tireless pioneer. Upon Nancy
Smith rested the burden of the family and the farm. When
help could not be secured, she would go forth herself into
the busy field to tend the growing crop, or to superintend
the gathering of the harvest, that her faithful husband might
devote all his energies to the cause to which they were both
so much devoted. His preaching brought no material recompense
to relieve their pinching poverty. Though he
labored incessantly for the salvation of his fellow men, no
one ever thought of contributing to his support, or if they
felt inclined to minister to him in temporal things were
probably too poor. During the years 1825-1830, in which
he laid the foundation of primitive Christianity in Kentucky,
he never received a dollar for his services, or compensation
of any kind, save the remittance to a friendly merchant in
a neighboring town for a small bill of goods.</p>
<p>The result of such zeal, such labor, such sacrifice, brought
its reward to this devoted messenger of truth in a richer
blessing than any that material prosperity had to offer. His
message was gladly received. Multitudes gathered to hear
him, and many received with joy the glorious Gospel of the
Son of God which he now felt himself commissioned to
preach. A revival of religious interest began to follow the
track of his ministry, and he had the satisfaction of seeing
hundreds, who had held aloof from the religious systems of
the day, now turn to the Lord. So fruitful were his labors
that within a short period of six months he was able to
report seven hundred conversions and five new churches
organized. But greater still, he had established a great
cause in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Although he had renounced the Calvinistic theory of conversion,
and had laid aside its unyielding creed for the New
Testament, he still considered himself a Baptist, and lived
in fellowship with those who &ldquo;stood resolutely by the old
church covenant&rdquo;, hoping that his brethren would one day
accept the primitive Gospel. But his genial fraternal spirit
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
was far from being reciprocated by the Baptist preachers
with whom he associated. Once, meeting an old acquaintance,
Smith said to him, kindly, &ldquo;Good morning, my brother.&rdquo;
To which the other scornfully replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me brother,
sir! I would rather claim kinship with the devil himself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;and honor thy father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bitterness of opposition did not always end in
harmless railery. It too frequently resorted to misrepresentations
and other unchristian means to check his growing
popularity and influence. Churches were closed against
him, compelling him to take his audience to some neighboring
house, or hall, or, in fair weather, to a grove. But,
whatever the discouragement or hindrance, he continued to
preach. &ldquo;Usually he divided his discourses, which were
two or three hours long, into three divisions, according to
the objects he had in view; in the first he corrected misrepresentations;
in the second he exposed popular errors,
and in the third he presented the simple Gospel to the
people.&rdquo; Having taken his stand upon the Bible, he felt
himself secure. The truth made him fearless, and his courage
at last won respect for the unpopular position to which
he held.</p>
<h4 id="c86"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Ancient Order of Things&rdquo; Among the Baptists In Kentucky</span></h4>
<p>The years 1828-1830 were great years in the ministry of
John Smith. In them was witnessed the fruition of years
of self-sacrificing labor, and the triumph of the ancient
Gospel on the soil of Kentucky. The year 1828 was a
notable one among the Baptist associations. At the meetings
of three of the largest associations the Reformers were
in control, due in a very large degree to Smith&rsquo;s preaching.
As we have already seen, his influence over the people was
tremendous. The churches for which he preached regularly&mdash;Spencer&rsquo;s
Creek, Grassy Lick and Mount Sterling&mdash;reported
in their annual letters of 1828 to the North District
Association of which they were members, the baptism of
392 persons during the year. The twenty-four churches
of the Association reported the baptism of about nine hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
persons, &ldquo;the greater part of whom had been immersed
by Smith.&rdquo; Five new churches had been organized by Smith
on the Bible alone and became members of the Association.</p>
<p>The North District Association met in July, 1828. At
its meeting the previous year the Lulbegrud Church had
sent the following charges aimed at John Smith, but veiling
the object of their charge under the designation, &ldquo;one
of their preachers.&rdquo; The accusations were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. That, while it is the custom of Baptists to use as the
Word of God the King James translation, he had on two or
three occasions in public, and often privately in his family,
read from Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s translation.</p>
<p>2. That while it is the custom in the ceremony of baptism
to pronounce, &ldquo;I baptize you&rdquo;, he, on the contrary, is in
the habit of saying, &ldquo;immerse you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>3. That in administering the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, while it is
the custom to break the loaf into bits, small enough to be
readily taken into the mouth, yet he leaves the bread in large
pieces, teaching that each communicant shall break it for
himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without waiting for himself to be singled out, Smith
arose and said, &ldquo;I plead guilty to them all.&rdquo; After bitter
debating and wrangling over the charges it was finally voted
that they be laid over for another year. The meeting of
1828 was the time when these charges should be brought
up. Smith had been unceasingly engaged in preaching,
and marvelously successful in winning men to Christ
during the years. Still, when the Association met, he was
in doubt at first as to which side had the majority of messengers.
In the registration of messengers, it was soon
found that the majority were favorable to him. The messengers,
from the five new churches he had established
turned the scale in his favor. The charges were not mentioned
on the floor of the Association. In 1830 this Association
divided, ten churches voluntarily withdrawing and
forming a new association on Baptist principles. The North
District Association met for the last time as an advisory
council in 1831, and was dissolved one year later. Fourteen
churches and four parts of churches were enrolled on
the occasion of the dissolution. On the same day the
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
churches that had withdrawn from the Association two years
before met and formed a new association under the same
name.</p>
<p>The Bracken Association was the next to meet, in 1828.
Licking Association, rigidly Calvinistic and devoted to the
Philadelphia Confession of Faith, desired to enter into
mutual correspondence with Bracken, but had determined
as a condition of it to require from Bracken a pledge to
support the Philadelphia Confession of Faith, which no
doubt would have been given in 1827; but in the meantime
Smith had gone into that district, and preached among the
churches; and such men as Walter Warden and Jesse
Holton, already moved by the plea of Alexander Campbell,
and encouraged by the boldness and success of Smith, were
already favoring the return to the &ldquo;ancient order of things.&rdquo;
The letter came from Licking requiring the pledge and was
read before the Association. After a prolonged discussion
by various members, during which Smith sat in silence, he
finally saw his opportunity to speak. This opportunity was
given when James Arnold, a messenger from the North
Bend Association, moved that the terms proposed by Licking
be rejected, and that all further correspondence with
that body be dropped. Smith supported the proposition,
and as he rose to do so took from his saddle bags a copy
of the Confession of Faith, and said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brethren, Licking requires of Bracken an utter impossibility.
No one can maintain inviolate the doctrine of grace
as revealed in the Scriptures, and at the same time, defend
that which is taught in the Philadelphia Confession of Faith;
for the doctrine of the creed is not the doctrine of the Bible.
No two books in the world differ more than these; and in no
point do they differ more widely than on the doctrine of
salvation by grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then contrasted the teaching of the New Testament
with that of the Confession of Faith, and his argument was
so convincing that practically all seemed satisfied that the
terms proposed by Licking were contradictory, and when
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
the vote was taken the proposition to reject was carried
almost unanimously. A prominent witness of these events
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was John Smith that gave impulse and tone to the
reformation in Bracken, as he had already done in North District,
Boone&rsquo;s Creek and other associations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was decided while the Association was in session that
Bracken would recommend no creed or confession of faith
but the New Testament. Bracken did not, however, remain
long of this mind; but went back into regular fellowship
in 1830; yet not without great loss by defection to the side
of those contending for the &ldquo;ancient order of things&rdquo;.
Benedict, the Baptist historian, informs us that &ldquo;the number
of members was reduced from 2,200 to 900 on account
of the sweeping inroads of the Reformers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next association to take action in 1828 was the
Boone&rsquo;s Creek. The letter sent out by the Association in
1827 said to the churches composing it: &ldquo;We hear from
some of the churches that they are endeavoring to return
to &lsquo;the ancient order of things&rsquo;, and they recognize the Scriptures
alone as an entire and sufficient rule of faith and practice.&rdquo;
During the spring and summer of 1828 there was
an increase of about 870 members by immersion, many of
whom had been brought in through the preaching of John
Smith. The Association, composed of thirteen churches,
met on the third Sunday in September. The question before
it, raised in letters of two churches, was concerning
an amendment to the constitution to bring it into harmony
with the Word of God. The following action was taken
by the Association and reported back to all the churches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We, therefore, recommend to the churches an abolition of
the present constitution, and, in lieu thereof, an adoption of
this resolution: Resolved, That we the Churches of Jesus
Christ, believing the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament
to be the Word of God, and the only rule of faith and
obedience given by the great Head of the Church for its government,
do agree to meet annually on every third Saturday,
Lord&rsquo;s day, and Monday in September of each year, for the
worship of God, and on such occasions voluntarily communicate
the state of religion amongst us by letter and messenger.
(Christian Baptist, Vol. 6. page 420.)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Such men as John Smith, William Morton, Jeremiah
Vardeman and Jacob Creath, Jr., all under the influence of
the restoration movement, were the leading spirits in this
meeting. The report of the action of churches with reference
to the resolution was made a year later. The result
showed that seven churches voted to retain the constitution,
six voted to abolish it. At the meeting in 1830 these six
churches were dropped from the Association, and both the
North District and Tate&rsquo;s Creek messengers were rejected.</p>
<p>In 1829 Tate&rsquo;s Creek Association was under the controlling
influence of the restoration movement. A minority
of orthodox Baptist churches withdrew and called a meeting
for the month of June, 1830, at which they drew up a bill
of errors against certain preachers and churches of the Association.
This Association was composed of delegates from
ten of the twenty-six churches. They organized and proceeded
to meet as the &ldquo;Tate&rsquo;s Creek Association&rdquo;, and resolved
to cut off correspondence with the churches that
&ldquo;tolerated the heresy of Campbellism&rdquo;. Thus we see that
the majority of this Association was in line with the effort
to restore the &ldquo;ancient order of things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Franklin and Elkhorn Associations were, however,
not friendly to the movement, though there was a strong
and influential minority committed to those principles. In
1829 Franklin Association adopted decrees rejecting as
heretical all those who sought to return to apostolic Christianity
and all churches were warned not to harbor any such
errors. The Elkhorn Association at its meeting in 1830
dropped from further correspondence two churches, and
refused to recognize the messengers from the North District,
thus excluding from Baptist fellowship eighteen
churches and 1,427 members.</p>
<p>The Russell Creek and South Concord Associations took
action against &ldquo;Campbellite heresy&rdquo;, the latter passing a
resolution advising all churches to lock their doors against
&ldquo;the followers of Alexander Campbell, who deny the agency
of the Spirit&rdquo;. Very few of the Kentucky Baptist Associations
escaped the influence of the effort to return to primitive
Christianity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The success of the movement only increased the bitterness
and hate of the opposition. No longer satisfied with
misrepresentation, and with closing the doors of their meeting
places against Smith, the leaders of the Baptist churches
formulated measures for the forcible expulsion of all who
gave heed to the teaching of Smith and his co-workers. As
this purpose spread from church to church and from association
to association, Smith threw himself fearlessly into the
breach, and with his rugged eloquence sought to stay any
attempt at disruption, and to preserve the peace and order
of religious society. As the heat of this controversy grew
intense, his genial spirit and good-fellowship were only the
more manifest. In the excitement of the times he alone
was calm. Amidst the cloud of angry faces that often
denied him a hearing, his countenance alone was lit up with
a friendly smile. When the doors were locked against him
by some unfriendly hand, he would speak to those who
gathered to hear him on such occasions in the woods, refusing
to sanction any act of violence by which admittance
might be gained. Though from this time in the thickest
of the fight, he was a man of peace; and while others
&ldquo;gnashed on him with their teeth&rdquo;, he only replied in pleasantries.
The principles for which he now contended were
the right of free speech and private judgment. As railing
accusations were brought against him and those who shared
his views, he would usually seek the opportunity of replying,
but was invariably refused the simple privilege claimed.</p>
<p>The effort of John Smith, therefore, to maintain the unity
of the Baptist Church on the broad platform which he had
framed for himself was soon found unavailing. The unyielding
policy of those who were antagonistic to apostolic
Christianity was to deny fellowship to those who joined in
the search to learn the way of the Lord more perfectly.
&ldquo;Seek first to reclaim these reformers from their error&rdquo;,
was the method now suggested; &ldquo;if your efforts should fail,
invite them to leave you, and to practice their reformation
to themselves. If they will not go at your request, separate
them from you in the best way you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henceforth his whole energy and strength were consumed
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
in setting in order the things lacking and strengthening
the faith of the brethren. At this time there were about
eight thousand intelligent, pious men and women in the State
standing with Smith. During the winter and spring of
1831 he gave himself unreservedly to the rejected churches
of the old North District Association, organizing them after
the New Testament model, and pressing the claims of the
primitive Gospel of larger conquest.</p>

<h3 id="c87">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="h3line2">WALTER SCOTT</span></h3>
<p>Inasmuch as the name of Walter Scott is inseparably
linked with the movement to restore apostolic Christianity,
I now give a sketch of his life and work. He was born in
Dumfriesshire, Scotland, October 31, 1796. He was carefully
trained in the Scotch Presbyterian Church by his
mother. At the very early period in his life he gave
evidence of a decided talent. Though the resources of the
family were only moderate, his watchful parents gave him
every educational advantage, the mother praying that the
church might enjoy the service of his rare gift of mind
and heart. The Scotch family of the old school sought
no greater honor than to have a son at the university.
Though a collegiate education at that time was regarded
within the reach of the sons of the wealthy only, in his
devoted family the slender resources were so husbanded as
to enable Walter, after a preparatory course at the academy,
to enter the University of Edinburgh. Here he pursued
his studies with a zeal and success that fully justified the
labors and sacrifices of his parents. After completing his
university course, while casting about for a place to plant
his feet and enter the service of his race, an unexpected
turn of affairs changed the channels of his life. His
mother&rsquo;s brother, George Innis, had some years before
emigrated to this country, and by faithfulness and integrity
advanced himself to a place of responsibility in the governmental
service in New York City. Anxious to assist
his relatives still in Scotland, he wrote his sister to send
one of her sons, promising what assistance he could render
in his advancement. Walter, as the best fitted by education
for the opportunities of a new country, was the one selected
to go; and as the plan was in perfect harmony with his own
wishes, he at once started on the voyage, reaching New York
on July 7, 1818, and on his arrival was kindly welcomed by
his uncle, through whose influence he soon obtained a position
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
as Latin tutor in a classical academy, for which he was
eminently qualified. But in this position he did not long
remain. He had made some acquaintances in the city, and
from them heard glowing reports of the West, as all the
region beyond the Allegheny Mountains was then called;
and had resolved to see for himself the land of which he
had heard so much. On foot, with a light heart and a
light purse, with a young man about his own age as a traveling
companion, he set out for the regions beyond. After
a long journey he reached Pittsburgh in the early spring
of 1819. He sought employment, and soon had the good
fortune to fall in with George Forrester, a fellow countryman,
and the principal of an academy, by whom he was
immediately engaged as an assistant in his school. Somewhat
to the surprise of young Scott, he soon made the discovery
that his employer, though a deeply religious man,
differed very much in his views from those which he himself
had been taught to regard as true. Mr. Forrester&rsquo;s
peculiarity consisted in making the Bible his only authority
and guide in religious matters, while Scott had been trained
to regard the Presbyterian Standards as the true and
authoritative exposition and summary of Bible truth.</p>
<h4 id="c88">A SINCERE TRUTH SEEKER</h4>
<p>Mr. Forrester had been trained under the Haldanes of
Scotland before coming to this country, and had in connection
with his school duties, built up a small congregation
who shared his views. Differing, as they did, they were,
nevertheless, both lovers of the truth, and the frequent and
close examinations which they made of the Scriptures resulted
in convincing Scott that human standards in religion
were, like their authors, imperfect; and in impressing him
deeply with the conviction that the Word of God is the
only true and sure guide. Better soil for the planting was
not to be found than that presented in the heart of Walter
Scott. He was a sincere truth seeker. He loved the Bible
and was ready to accept whatever it clearly taught. No
sooner, therefore, did he learn of this new religious movement
than he set about diligently to test the correctness of
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
his employer&rsquo;s views. Together they made an earnest,
prayerful search of the Scriptures. Often, after the labors
of the day had closed in the school room, they would prosecute
their examinations of the Scriptures far into the night;
not in the spirit of controversy, however, but with an earnest
desire to know the will of God, and a determination to follow
wherever his Word, the expression of his will, should
lead.</p>
<p>The result of this painstaking search was that in a few
weeks he turned his back upon his past religious training,
convinced that human standards of belief were without the
sanction of God&rsquo;s Word. This conclusion was not reached
without much anguish of spirit. He further discovered
that though he had adhered, in all strictness, to the church
traditions, he had not obeyed some of the important commands
of the Bible. Among his first discoveries, in his
conscientious search of truth, was the absence of scriptural
authority for infant baptism, and his need of personal obedience
to a command so repeatedly enforced as that of baptism
into Christ. He, therefore, announced his purpose to
reject all authority but that of Christ, and in obedience to
the divine command he was immersed by Mr. Forrester and
immediately entered into hearty co-operation with the small
congregation planted by Mr. Forrester.</p>
<p>He at once proved himself a valuable addition to this
struggling congregation. Although he did not immediately
take a public part in the services, his genial presence, zealous
devotion, and Christian culture were an inspiration to the
whole congregation. He humbly accepted the position of
learner, continued his diligent search of the Scriptures and
rejoiced in his new-found faith. In the meantime Mr.
Forrester, desiring to devote himself exclusively to religious
work, turned over the management of the school to his
talented assistant.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott&rsquo;s original methods of instruction, his pleasing
manner and faultless character won for his school a wide
reputation and patronage. Had success in this line been
the goal of his ambition, his situation would have proved
eminently satisfactory; but this was not his ambition. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
more he studied the Bible the more he felt drawn toward
the ministry of the Word. A new world of religious truth
was gradually unfolding before him. He soon found that
even his teachers in this new religious school but partially
apprehended the divine purpose and method in the world&rsquo;s
salvation. From his study of the Bible, especially Acts of
Apostles, which now enlisted his attention, the plan of redemption
began to take form in his mind. Conversion had
always been a perplexing subject to him, but in the light
of this book all mystery fled. He now found that all who
heard, believed and obeyed the glad message of salvation
were filled with peace and joy in believing.</p>
<p>While pursuing this line of investigation a small tract,
sent out by an obscure congregation in New York, fell into
his hands. The views expressed in it so perfectly coincided
with those he now held that he determined to get acquainted
with its authors, feeling that such an association would add
greatly to his Christian knowledge. He, therefore, at once
severed his connection with the school and set out in search
for more light upon the great religious problems that now
consumed his thought. The visit proved a keen disappointment.
He found the practice of the church much different
from what he had been led to expect from their publication.
So after a short sojourn in the city, with a heavy heart he
continued his journey, visiting Baltimore and Washington,
in each of which he had learned of small congregations of
independent believers; but these visits only added to his
disappointment. These early attempts at religious reformation
were not always successful and frequently resulted
in a caricature of the thing attempted. In describing his
fruitless journey he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went thither, and having searched them up I discovered
them to be so sunken in the mire of Calvinism that they refused
to reform; and so finding no pleasure in them I left them. I
then went to the Capitol, and, climbing up to its lofty dome,
I sat myself down, filled with sorrow at the miserable desolation
of the Church of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His drooping spirit was cheered by his return to Pittsburgh,
after a journey on foot of three hundred miles. He
received a warm welcome from those who had learned his
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
true worth, and, as a suitable successor in the school room
had not been found, a handsome salary was pledged to secure
his services once more. Broken in spirit and purse, he
accepted the position and continued in the management of
the school for several years with remarkable success. But
his chief delight now was to minister to the little church,
which, deprived of its leader by the sudden death of Mr.
Forrester, looked to him for leadership. This period marks
his growth in spiritual things. His reverence for Christ
and his Word led to the constant study of the Bible. His
chief delight was in the Holy Scriptures. It was in these
hours with the Spirit of truth that he made the final dedication
of himself to God, promising &ldquo;that if he, for Christ&rsquo;s
sake, would grant him just and comprehensive views of his
religion he would subordinate all his present and future
attainments to the glory of his Son and his religion.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c89">TURNING POINT IN HIS LIFE</h4>
<p>It was while thus engaged singlehanded in working out
the problem of human redemption as revealed in the Word
of God that he first met Alexander Campbell, with whom
his own history and efforts in the future were to be so
intimately blended. They possessed many elements in common,
had been reared in the same school of religious thought,
had been driven by the same burning thirst for truth to the
Bible, and through its message were led to pursue a similar
path in their search for acceptance with God. The following,
from the pen of Dr. Richardson, beautifully presents
the predominating characteristics in contrast at the time of
their first meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The different hues in the characters of these two eminent
men were such as to be, so to speak, complimentary to each
other, and to form, by their harmonious blending, a completeness
and a brilliancy which rendered their society, peculiarly
delightful to each other. Thus, while Mr. Campbell was fearless,
self-reliant and firm, Mr. Scott was naturally timid, diffident
and yielding; and, while the former was calm, steady and
prudent, the latter was excitable, variable and precipitate.
The one, like the north star, was ever in position, unaffected
by terrestrial influences; the other, like the magnetic needle,
was often disturbed and trembling on its center, yet ever returning
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
or seeking to return to its true direction. Both were
nobly endowed with the powers of higher reason&mdash;a delicate
self-consciousness, a decided will and a clear conception of
truth. But, as it regards the other departments of the inner
nature, in Mr. Campbell the understanding predominated, in
Mr. Scott the feelings; and, if the former excelled in imagination,
the latter was superior in brilliancy of fancy. If the
tendency of one was to generalize, to take wide and extended
views and to group a multitude of particulars under a single
head or principle, that of the other was to analyze, to divide
subjects into their particulars and consider their details....
In a word, in almost all those qualities of mind and
character, which might be regarded differential or distinctive,
they were singularly fitted to supply each other&rsquo;s wants and
to form a rare and delightful companionship. (Memoirs of
A. Campbell, Vol. 1, p. 510.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They at once recognized in each other kindred spirits
and joined hands, and, with Thomas Campbell, formed a
trio of unsurpassed genius, eloquence and devotion to truth.</p>
<h4>WALTER SCOTT</h4>
<p>The turning point in the life of Walter Scott came in
1827, when Alexander Campbell, on the way to the annual
meeting of the Mahoning Association, visited him at his home
in Steubensville, Ohio, and prevailed upon him to attend the
meeting at New Lisbon. Scott, though not a member of
the Association, was chosen evangelist.</p>
<p>The Association was organized in 1820 and was composed
of ten Baptist churches. The number was doubled
later, seventeen of whom were represented at the New
Lisbon meeting. These churches in the main were in eastern
Ohio, near the Pennsylvania line, and between the Ohio
River and Lake Erie, and were known as the Western
Reserve. One of the churches&mdash;Wellsburg&mdash;was in Virginia.
Spiritually they were almost dead. This, perhaps,
was the result of extreme Calvinistic teachings and their
elaborate man-made creeds. At this association fifteen
churches reported only thirty-four baptisms, and eleven of
these were at Wellsburg, the church home of Alexander
Campbell.</p>
<p>The new evangelist threw the full force of his ardent
nature into the work. He had long been an earnest, faithful,
and prayerful student of the Word of God. He had drunk
deep into its spirit, and became fully convinced of the weakness
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
and inefficiency of modern systems, in all of which
&ldquo;there seemed to be a link wanting to connect an avowed
faith in Christ with an immediate realization of the promises
of the gospel. These seemed placed at an almost infinite
distance from the penitent, bowed down under a sense of
guilt, and longing for some certain evidence of acceptance,
which he often vainly sought in the special spiritual illuminations
upon which men were taught to rely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Association had imposed upon him no particular
course whatever, and it was his duty, therefore, to consider
how the proclamation of the gospel could be rendered most
effective for the conversion of sinners.</p>
<p>In view of all the circumstances, this was a very difficult
and perplexing question with which to grapple. He was
aware of the fact that Mr. Campbell had spoken of baptism
in his debate with McCalla as a pledge of pardon, but in this
point of view it was, as yet, contemplated only <i>theoretically</i>.
However, his knowledge of the Scriptures led him to think
that baptism was in some way intimately connected with the
personal enjoyment of the blessings of the gospel, but as yet
he was unable to perceive just what position it occupied in
relation to other requirements.</p>
<p>After a more diligent and prayerful study of the Word
of God, and many conferences with other pious and godly
men, it became clear to Scott that the Gospel contained facts
to be believed, commands to be obeyed, and promises to be
enjoyed. But in its specific application it was five-fold: (1)
Faith to change the heart; (2) Repentance to change the
life; (3) Baptism to change the state; (4) Remission of
sins to cleanse from guilt; (5) The gift of the Holy Spirit
to help in the Christian life and make one a partaker of the
divine nature. This arrangement of these items was so manifestly
in harmony with the Scriptures that he was transported
with the discovery. The key of knowledge was now
in his possession. The things that before were dark and
perplexing were now clear and he resolved to preach the
same Gospel preached by inspired men, and to preach it in
the same way. From his present viewpoint the Word of
God was for the salvation of the world, and the inspired
teachers made no mistake in their method of preaching it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
This was a bold and novel thing to do, but he believed it to
be right, and he had the courage of his convictions, and proceeded
to do it.</p>
<p>Fearing that he might give cause of offense to the
churches which had employed him, he sent an appointment
outside the limits of the Association, and with some misgivings,
but in an earnest and interesting manner, laid before
the audience his analysis of the Gospel, and at the close he
gave a formal invitation to any one so disposed to come forward,
confess his faith in Christ and be baptized for the
remission of sins; but no one came. To his audience this
was like the proclamation of a new religion, so different did
it seem from the orthodoxy of the day. They regarded him
as an amiable but deluded enthusiast, and looked upon him
with wonder, pity, and even scorn. This result was not
unexpected, for the whole community was filled with the
idea that something supernatural had to occur before any
one could become a fit subject for baptism. Instead of giving
way to this traditional prejudice, he said to himself &ldquo;This
way is of God, and ought to succeed, and with his help it
shall.&rdquo; He was right, and God gave him success, as he gives
to all such men. He accordingly announced that he would
deliver a series of discourses on the Ancient Gospel at New
Lisbon, Ohio, the place at which he had been selected as
evangelist by the Association a few months before. Here
he was to witness the removal of the barriers and the triumph
of the cause that was so near his heart.</p>
<p>When he arrived on Sunday to begin the series of meetings
every seat in the building was literally packed, soon
even standing room was at a premium, and the doorway was
blocked up by the eager throng. Scott was just the man
to be moved to the highest point by such an occasion. The
following is a vivid description of the events of that day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His theme was the confession of Peter, &ldquo;Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16), and the
promise which grew out of it, that he should have entrusted to
him the keys of the kingdom of heaven. The declaration of
Peter was a theme upon which he had thought for years; it was
a fact which he regarded the four gospels was written to
establish; to which type and prophecy had pointed in all the
ages gone by; which the Eternal Father had announced from
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
heaven when out of the waters of Jordan and the Spirit descended
and abode upon him, and which was repeated again
amid the awful grandeur and solemnity of the transfiguration
scene. He then proceeded to show that the foundation truth
of Christianity was the divine nature of the Lord Jesus&mdash;the
central truth around which all others revolved, and from
which they derived their efficacy and importance&mdash;and that
the belief of it was calculated to produce such love in the
heart of him who believed as would lead him to true obedience
to the object of his faith and love. To show how that love
and faith were to be manifested, he quoted the language of
the great commission (Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15,16), and
called attention to the fact that Jesus had taught his apostles
&ldquo;that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem&rdquo; (Luke
24:47). He then led his hearers to Jerusalem on the memorable
Pentecost and bade them listen to an authoritative announcement
of the law of Christ, now to be made known for
the first time by Peter to whom Christ had promised to give
the keys of the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 16:16), which he
represented as meaning the conditions upon which the guilty
might find pardon at the hands of the risen, ascended, and
glorified Son of God, and enter his kingdom.</p>
<p>After a rapid yet graphic review of Peter&rsquo;s discourse, he
pointed out its effect on those that heard him, and bade them
mark the inquiry which a deep conviction of the truth they
had heard forced from the lips of the heart-pierced multitudes,
who, in their agony at the discovery that they had put to death
the Son of God, their own long-expected Messiah, &ldquo;said unto
Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo;
and then with flashing eyes and impassioned manner, as if
he fully realized that he was but re-echoing the words of one
who spake as the Spirit gave him utterance, he gave the reply,
&ldquo;Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; He then, with great force
and power, made his application; he insisted that the conditions
were unchanged, that the Word of God meant what it
said, and that to receive and obey it was to obey God and to
imitate the example of those who, under the preaching of the
apostles, gladly accepted the gospel message. His discourse
was long, but his hearers marked not the flight of time. The
Baptists forgot, in admiration of its scriptural beauty and
simplicity, that it was contrary to much of their own teaching
and practice; some of them who had been, in a measure, enlightened
before, rejoiced in the truth the moment they perceived
it; to others, who had long been perplexed by the difficulties
and contradictions of the discordant views of the day, it
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
was light like light to weary travelers long benighted and lost.</p>
<p>The man of all others, however, in that community who
would most have delighted in and gladly accepted those views,
so old and yet so new, was not there, although almost in hearing
of the preacher, who, with such eloquence and power, was
setting forth the primitive gospel. This was William Amend,
a pious, God-fearing man, a member of the Presbyterian
Church, and regarded by his neighbors as an &ldquo;Israelite indeed.&rdquo;
He had for some time entertained the same views as
those Mr. Scott was then preaching in that place for the first
time, but was not aware of the fact that any one agreed with
him. He was under the impression that all the churches&mdash;his
own among the number&mdash;had departed from the plain teachings
of the Word of God. He had discovered, some time before,
that infant baptism was not taught in the Bible, and, consequently,
that he was not a baptized man; the act of baptism
seemed also to him to have been changed, and he sought his
pastor, and asked to be immersed. His pastor endeavored to
convince him that he was wrong, but finding that he could not
be turned from his purpose, he proposed to immerse him privately,
lest others of his flock might be unsettled in their minds
by his so doing, and closed by saying that baptism was not
essential to salvation. Mr. Amend regarded everything that
Christ had ordained as being essential, and replied that he
should not immerse him at all; that he would wait until he
found a man who believed the gospel, and who could, without
any scruple, administer the ordinance as he conceived it to be
taught in the New Testament.</p>
<p>He was invited a day or two before to hear Mr. Scott,
but knowing nothing of his views, he supposed that he preached
much as others did, but agreed to go and hear him. It was
near the close of the services when he reached the Baptist
Church and joined the crowd at the door, who were unable to
get into the house. The first sentence he heard aroused and
excited him; it sounded like the gospel which he had read with
such interest at home, but never had heard from the pulpit
before. He now felt a great anxiety to see the man who was
speaking so much like the oracles of God, and pressed through
the throng into the house.</p>
<p>Mr. Dibble, the clerk of the church, saw him enter, and
knowing that he had been seeking and longing to find a man
who would preach as the Word of God read, thought within
himself, &ldquo;Had Mr. Amend been here during all this discourse
I feel sure that he would have found what he has so long
sought in vain. I wish the preacher would repeat what he said
before he came in.&rdquo; Greatly to his surprise Mr. Scott did give
a brief review of the various points of his discourse, insisting
that the Word of God meant what it said, and urging his hearers
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
to trust that Word implicitly. He rehearsed again the
Jerusalem scene, called attention to the earnest, anxious cry
of the multitude, and the comforting reply of the apostle,
&ldquo;Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; He invited any one present
who believed with all his heart to yield to the terms proposed
in the words of the apostle, and show by a willing obedience
his trust in the Lord of life and glory. Mr. Amend
pressed his way through the crowd to the preacher and made
known his purpose; made a public confession of his faith in
Jesus Christ as the Son of the living God and expressed his
desire to obey him, at once, and on the same day, in a beautiful,
clear stream which flows on the southern border of the
town, in the presence of a great multitude, he was baptized
in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. (Life
of Walter Scott, pages 104-108.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that day the meeting continued with increasing
interest. Seventeen persons, &ldquo;hearing, believed, and were
baptized.&rdquo; The whole community was aroused and began
to search the scriptures, some in the same spirit of the
Bereans of old to see whether these things were so; others
with no higher purpose than to file objections to that which
was so boldly proclaimed, and many of these were forced
to admit that if the teaching were false the Bible could not
be true, for the preacher could read everything that was demanded
from the Word of God.</p>
<p>It was a fortunate thing that a man with such an unsullied
character and reputation as that of Mr. Amend should
be the first to render obedience to the apostolic teaching at
New Lisbon. He was a man with more than ordinary intelligence,
and his scriptural knowledge was far beyond that of
most men in his station in life. His action was not the result
of an impulse produced by Mr. Scott&rsquo;s discourse, for that he
had not heard; but from a careful study of the Word of God.
He was not aware of the fact that there was another person
in the world who held similar views to his own.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Scott was pleased with the initial success,
it was still a mystery to him why his first discourse had failed
to convince any one, and that at the close of the second, Mr.
Amend, who had heard neither of them, should come forward
so intelligently; hence he wrote a letter requesting him
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
to state the facts which induced him to respond to the invitation
so promptly, to which he replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, my brother, I will answer your questions. I was
baptized November 18, 1827, and I will relate to you a circumstance
which occurred a few days before that date. I had
read the second chapter of Acts when I expressed myself to
my wife as follows: &ldquo;Oh, this is the gospel&mdash;this is the thing
we wish&mdash;remission of our sins! Oh, that I could hear the
gospel in these same words&mdash;as Peter preached it! I hope I
shall some day hear it; and the first man I meet who will preach
the gospel thus, with him will I go.&rdquo; So, my brother, on the
day you saw me come into the meeting-house, my heart was
open to receive the Word of God, and when you cried, &ldquo;The
scriptures no longer shall be a sealed book. God means what
he says. Is there any man who will take God at his word, and
be baptized for the remission of sins?&rdquo; at that moment my
feelings were such that I could have cried out, &ldquo;Glory to God!
I have found the man for whom I have long sought.&rdquo; So I
entered the kingdom where I readily laid hold of the hope set
before me. (Life of Walter Scott, page 113.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within three weeks after the close of the meeting at
New Lisbon, Mr. Scott returned and found the interest there
greater than when he left, and seven others were baptized.
Soon after this he visited there again, and baptized more
than thirty others. The members of the Baptist Church
gladly accepted the truth, and resolved that thenceforth the
Bible should be their only rule of faith and practice.</p>
<p>The ice was now broken, and a new era was inaugurated
which was marked by a quiet thoughtfulness, and an unwonted
searching of the Scriptures, &ldquo;whether these things
were so,&rdquo; and a final decision to obey the personal Christ,
expressed in public confession of faith in Christ and baptism.
The country was aroused as never before. The conversion
of Mr. Amend confirmed Mr. Scott in his conviction that
the way preached and practiced by God&rsquo;s inspired messengers
at Pentecost was the right way. His labors and success
aroused much inquiry and great opposition, and the
wildest rumors were circulated concerning his preaching and
work. The interest in the public mind swelled to a torrent
which swept everything before it. Not only individuals by
the hundreds became obedient to the faith, but often entire
congregations would wheel into line with the &ldquo;ancient order
of things.&rdquo; Baptist congregations voted out the Philadelphia
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
Confession of Faith and substituted the New Testament
in its place. And not only the Baptists, but Presbyterians,
Universalists, Lutherans, Christian Connectionists, Methodists,
and Episcopalians in large numbers were reached. The
Deerfield Methodist Church came in as a whole.</p>
<p>Exaggerated reports concerning the teaching and practice
of Mr. Scott reached Mr. Campbell and he became fearful
lest his zeal and youthful inexperience should lead him
into serious error. He therefore decided that it would be
well for his father, Thomas Campbell, to visit his field of
labor and ascertain the truth concerning the state of affairs.
Upon arriving, he heard Mr. Scott&rsquo;s presentation of the
gospel and witnessed his method of procedure with surprise
and great pleasure. It at once became apparent to him that
what he and his son had taught was now reduced to practice,
and that the rumors that had reached him were untrue. He
therefore remained in this promising field some time, and by
his earnest and efficient labors gave great assistance to the
work. On April 9, 1828, from New Lisbon, he wrote to his
son giving his impressions of the work, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I perceive that theory and practice in religion, as well as
in other things, are matters of distinct consideration. It is one
thing to know the art of fishing&mdash;for instance the rod, the line,
and the hook, and the bait, too; and quite another thing to
handle them dextrously when thrown into the water, so as to
make it take. We have spoken and long known the former
(the theory), and have spoken and published many things
correctly concerning the ancient gospel, its simplicity and perfect
adaptation to the present state of mankind, for the benign
and gracious purpose of his immediate relief and complete
salvation; but I must confess that, in respect to the direct
exhibition and application of it for that blessed purpose, I am
at present for the first time upon the ground where the thing
has appeared to be practically applied to the proper purpose.
&ldquo;Compel them to come in, saith the Lord, that my house may
be filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Scott has made a bold push to accomplish this object,
by simply and boldly stating the ancient gospel, and insisting
upon it; and then by putting the question generally and particularly
to male and female, old and young: &ldquo;Will you come
to Christ and be baptized for the remission of your sins and
the gift of the Holy Spirit? Don&rsquo;t you believe this blessed
gospel? Then come away.&rdquo; This elicits a personal conversation;
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
some confess faith in the testimony, beg time to think;
others consent, give their hand to be baptized as soon as convenient;
others debate the matter friendly; some go straight
to the water, be it day or night, and upon the whole none
appear offended. (Life of Walter Scott, pages 158, 159.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the first year many languishing churches
had been brought into living activity, many new ones had
been organized, and a thousand persons had been baptized
into Christ. Mr. Scott was unanimously chosen to continue
in the work, and he consented, stipulating only that he should
have William Hayden, a zealous young preacher and sweet
singer, to assist him. But his second year was one of great
conflict. By this time, those bound by sectarian traditions
began to realize if Scott were allowed to continue preaching
what they called &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; unopposed as he had been allowed
to do during the preceding year, sectarianism was doomed,
hence the opposition became extremely fierce. That you may
have some idea of the conflict that ensued all over the country,
I give a brief history of the introduction of the ancient
gospel at Sharon, Pa. Just a short distance over the state
line in Ohio, the Baptist churches at Warren and Hubbard
had accepted it almost in a body, so generally indeed, that
both houses of worship passed quietly out of the hands of
the Baptists; and in the case at Warren, not only the greater
part of the congregation, but the preacher also accepted the
truth so ably and eloquently urged by Scott, and became himself
an earnest and successful advocate of the same. Some
of the Baptists had heard of the great changes that had taken
place in the two churches mentioned; some of the members
had even gone so far as to visit them, and could find no well-founded
objections to what they had heard stigmatized as
heresy; nay, it even seemed to them like the things they had
read in the Bible; and some of them went so far as to sit
down at the Lord&rsquo;s table with them. Such an element in the
church, of course, soon made itself felt. The Scriptures
were closely searched, and the light began to spread. Suspicion
was aroused&mdash;was the hated &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; about to break
out among them and destroy their peace? Several were soon
marked men; the views they held were assailed and loudly
condemned, when some one suggested that, as it was not the
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
custom to condemn without a hearing in ancient time, they
had better send for the public advocates of the new doctrine
and learn the best or worst at once. This suggestion prevailed
and Scott and Bently were invited to preach at Sharon.
They came and Scott preached every night for three weeks.
The curiosity which at first characterized many who attended
soon deepened into sincere interest, and some began to inquire,
&ldquo;Brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo; The inspired answer
was given, and, in response to the gospel invitation, several
persons presented themselves and were immediately, on a confession
of their faith in Christ as the Son of God, baptized.</p>
<p>Shortly after this meeting closed the cry was raised that
what had been done was not according to &ldquo;Baptist usage.&rdquo;
Those who had been baptized had not been required to relate
an experience of grace prior to baptism, and the church had
not been allowed to pass on their fitness for membership, and
so they were not received as members. But there was another
serious trouble that could not be so easily settled. They
could refuse to receive into their fellowship those baptized
by Mr. Scott; but what was to be done with those who received
with gladness the message delivered by him as the
word of God? Some of these were the most influential
members, and to make the case more perplexing, were tolerant
of the views held by the Baptists. As they had formerly
held the same, they desired that the others should see
as they did; but they did not attempt to force their views
upon the church; they wished to hold them in peace, however,
but at the same time did not want to be bound by the
creed and church articles. All this class sympathized with
those who had been refused membership. In their view, if
the Lord, as they believed, had accepted them, why should
the church reject them?</p>
<p>Those who were still attached to the Baptist views were
of a different spirit. And they were fully determined that
all who even sympathized with those whom they regarded as
heretics should either repent or be excluded from their fellowship.
This naturally produced serious trouble, and many
of the leading members left the church and cast their lot with
those endeavoring to restore the apostolic church. But the
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
opposition only stirred the evangelists to greater zeal and
power, and created for them a sympathy which opened the
doors to thousands of hearts hitherto closed to their message.
Like fighting fire in the stubble, the stroke of the
flail only increased the flame. Throughout the country they
went &ldquo;turning the country upside down,&rdquo; like the apostles
of old. So great was their influence that, when the Mahoning
Association met in 1830, it disbanded, and ceased its
connection with the Baptist Church, that church having repudiated
all who were set for a return to apostolic simplicity.</p>
<p>The three years spent by Mr. Scott in the Western
Reserve; the great audiences that greeted him, and the marvelous
success that crowned his labors, stimulated his fervent
nature to the highest and drew from his rich soul the rarest
wealth. His mind was filled with truth, and his thought
was illuminated with the finest imagery. He knew the Bible
as few men, and loved it with a passionate love. His life
was wholly given to the Savior, and never was a sacrifice
more unreservedly made. No wonder that a preacher like
this should revolutionize the hearts of men.</p>
<h4 id="c90">REFORMERS IN OTHER STATES
<br />JOHN WRIGHT</h4>
<p>In our study so far we have learned of several independent
movements, in widely separated localities, making strenuous
efforts to throw off the shackles of sectarianism and to
stand wholly on apostolic ground, and it is fitting that I should
give a brief sketch of others.</p>
<p>John Wright was born in Rowan County, North Carolina,
December 12, 1785. When he was about twelve years
old his father moved into Powell&rsquo;s Valley, Va., where he
grew to manhood. From Virginia the whole family emigrated
to Wayne County, Ky., where he was joined in marriage
to Miss Nancy Beeler, who proved to be a most excellent
helpmeet, ever ready with him to make any sacrifice for
the cause of Christ. In the latter part of 1807, he moved
from Kentucky into Clark&rsquo;s Grant, Indiana.</p>
<p>In August, 1808 he and his wife were baptized by William
Summers, and they immediately united with the Baptist
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
Church, and in the latter part of the same year he began to
preach. This was long before the current Reformation was
heard of by the inhabitants of the West. He was, therefore
among the very first to break the stillness of Indiana&rsquo;s forest
with the glad tidings of salvation. In January, 1810, he
moved to Blue River, four miles south of Salem, and was
shortly afterwards joined by his father, where they organized
a congregation of Free-Will Baptists. They exerted great
influence in behalf of Christianity, and it was not long until
they had organized ten Baptist Churches which they organized
into what was called Blue River Association.</p>
<p>From the very first, John Wright was of the opinion
that all human creeds were heretical and schismatical, and
in that region there has not come after him a more persistent
contender for the word of God as the only and all-sufficient
rule of faith and practice. He labored to destroy all divisions
and promote union among all professed followers of the
Lord; and in this difficult and most important service he was
very successful. Though at first he tolerated the name Baptist,
he afterwards waged a war of extermination against
all party names. This war was declared in the year 1819,
when he offered at the church at Blue River a resolution in
favor of discarding all party names. As individuals, he
contended that they should be called &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;disciples,&rdquo;
&ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christians;&rdquo; and, as a body, &ldquo;Church
of Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Church of God.&rdquo; He opposed the term
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; as applied to the church, because it is not so
applied in the writings of the apostles.</p>
<p>The resolution was adopted, and, having agreed, also,
to lay aside their speculative opinions and contradictory theories,
they were prepared to plead consistently for Christian
union, and to invite others to stand with them upon the one
broad and sure foundation. They then began in earnest the
work of reformation, and with such success that by the year
1821 there was not a Baptist Church in all that region.</p>
<p>About this time a spirited controversy over the subject
of Trine Immersion was being waged among the Tunkers,
of whom there were fifteen congregations in that section of
country. The leading spirits in opposition to that doctrine
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
were Abram Kern, of Indiana, and Peter Hon, of Kentucky.
At first they contended against great odds, but so
many of their opponents finally surrendered that they finally
gained a decisive victory in favor of one immersion. At the
close of the contest, while both parties were exhausted by
the conflict, Mr. Wright recommended to his brethren that
they should send a letter to the Annual Conference of the
Tunkers, proposing a union of the two bodies on the Bible
alone. The letter was written and John Wright, his brother,
Peter, and several others, were appointed as messengers to
convey it to the conference and there advocate the measures
it proposed. So successful was the effort that at the first
meeting the union was permanently formed.</p>
<p>About the same time Mr. Wright proposed a correspondence
with the Newlights, for the purpose of forming
with them a more perfect union. He was appointed to conduct
the correspondence on the part of his brethren, which he
did with so much ability and discretion, that a joint meeting
was assembled at Edinburg, where the union was readily consummated.</p>
<p>A few years subsequent to this, the work of reformation
began to progress rapidly among the Regular Baptists of the
Silver Creek Association. This was directly through the
influence of Absolom and J. T. Littell, and Mordecai Cole,
the leading spirits of that locality. Through their teaching
hundreds of individuals and some whole churches renounced
all human creeds and boldly took a stand on the Bible alone.
But still there was a shyness existing between them and those
who had done the same thing under the labors of Mr.
Wright. The former having held Calvinistic opinions, stood
aloof through fear of being called Arians; while the latter
feared to make any advances lest they should be stigmatized
as &ldquo;Campbellites.&rdquo; Thus the two parties stood when Mr.
Wright became their mediator communicating the sentiments
of each to the other. By this means it was soon ascertained
that they were all endeavoring to preach and practice
the same thing. The only important difference between them
was in regard to the design of baptism, and on this point
Mr. Wright yielded as soon as he was convinced of his error.
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
This move resulted in the permanent union of these two large
and influential bodies of believers. In consequence of this
effort at peace making, more than three thousand united in
the bonds of peace, agreeing to stand together on the one
foundation and to forget all minor differences in their devotion
to the great interests of the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom. This
was the greatest achievement of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s long and
eventful life; and he deserves to be held in high esteem for
his love of truth, for his moral courage in carrying out his
convictions of right, and for the meek and affectionate spirit
which gave him such power in leading people out of sectarianism
and uniting them together in the bonds of love in
Christ Jesus.</p>
<h4 id="c91">HERMAN CHRISTIAN DASHER</h4>
<p>The parents of Herman Christian Dasher came to this
country from Salzburg, Germany, to escape the persecution
of the Roman Catholic Church, and located near Savannah,
Georgia. They were Lutherans and had Herman christened
in infancy and brought up in that faith. When he arrived
at manhood and began to be impressed with the importance
of uniting with a church, and of living the Christian life, he
was deeply perplexed by the existence, and by the proclaiming
of so many contradictory doctrines. Fortunately, instead
of becoming an infidel, as so many do under like circumstances,
he turned to the Holy Scriptures for light. He soon
became thoroughly convinced that immersion is baptism, and
that affusion is not, and that therefore he ought to be immersed.</p>
<p>He could not cast his lot with the Baptists, as he could
not tell an experience of grace which they required, for he
had seen no marvelous light, neither had he heard any marvelous
sounds. He was by no means convinced &ldquo;that God
had for Christ&rsquo;s sake forgiven his sins,&rdquo; though he did not
then understand the doctrine of baptism for remission of
sins, as he afterwards did; nor did he think that God demanded
any such experience as a prerequisite to baptism and
church membership. But he desired most earnestly to become
a Christian, believing in his heart that Jesus is the
Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of sinners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>This brought before him a new difficulty, for within the
whole range of his acquaintance, there was not one who
would immerse him on a simple confession of his faith in
Christ. All demanded that he should profess to have a miraculous
and mysterious work of the Holy Spirit within him,
in taking away his heart of stone and giving him a heart of
flesh.</p>
<p>Providentially, about this time, while he was most earnestly
engaged in studying the Bible, he was thrown into the
company of a Mrs. Threadcraft, of Savannah, who informed
him that in her city a Mr. S. C. Dunning, who had formerly
been a Baptist preacher, but had recently seceded from that
body, because he did not believe it taught and practiced as
the Word of God required. In this movement he had been
accompanied by eight or ten others. This lady further informed
him that Mr. Dunning preached the Scriptures as
he did, and that at his hands he could obtain baptism upon
a simple confession of his faith in Jesus Christ as the Son
of God. This information filled him with such great joy
that he did not delay in making the journey into Savannah
to see Mr. Dunning, who baptized him without further delay.
This was during the year 1819.</p>
<p>Immediately after returning to his home he immersed
his wife, her sister and her husband. These &ldquo;continued
steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread and the prayers,&rdquo; meeting every Lord&rsquo;s
Day in the house of Mr. Dasher. The little church grew and
prospered, being occasionally visited by Mr. Dunning, who
assisted in building it up by his teaching and exhortations.</p>
<p>Some time after this, Mr. Dasher, accompanied by a
number of the members of the church, moved into Lowndes
County, and located where the city of Valdosta now stands.
In this new field he continued the work of preaching the
word and built up a congregation which met in his own residence.
This was the beginning of the work in Valdosta
and the region around about. It was many years after the
baptism of Mr. Dasher before he knew that there were any
others in any place contending for the &ldquo;truth as is in Jesus,&rdquo;
as he and those associated with him were doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<h3 id="c92">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="h3line2">THE CHRISTIANS AND REFORMERS UNITE</span></h3>
<p>A new period has now dawned in the movement for the
union of all Christians by the restoration of primitive Christianity.
The Baptists had thrust from their fellowship
those who had embraced it and they were forced into a separate
existence. Every preacher among them was filled with
a zeal to plant churches after the primitive order wherever
they could get a large enough company together.</p>
<p>The work spread principally from two centers, Ohio
and Kentucky. From Ohio it was carried into New York
and Pennsylvania; and westward into Michigan, northern
Ohio, and Indiana, and Wisconsin. From Kentucky it was
carried eastward and southward into Virginia, Maryland, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, and Alabama; and westward into Indiana,
Illinois and Missouri. The movement spread chiefly
in a westward direction from Kentucky and Tennessee along
the lines of emigration. Very often a sufficient number of
emigrants to establish themselves into a congregation after
the primitive order found themselves together in the same
neighborhood and began at once to meet together for mutual
edification and the spread of the truth.</p>
<p>While it was well known that there were many things
received and practiced in common there had been no special
effort to bring about a union between them. In 1824, at
Georgetown, Ky., Mr. Stone and Mr. Campbell first met.
When they compared views, it seemed that there were irreconcilable
differences between them. Stone thought Campbell
was heterodox on the Holy Spirit, and Campbell suspected
Stone&rsquo;s soundness on the divinity of Christ. But on
a more careful investigation, they found these differences
more imaginary than real, and they joined hearts and hands
and God blessed them with the most important work since
the apostolic age. With the kindly feelings towards each
other, the work of union between their brethren was well
on the way when it was begun. And so, after a number of
friendly conferences, it was decided to have a meeting of
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
representative men at Georgetown, Ky., to continue for days,
including December 25, 1831. The results of this conference
were so satisfactory that another was convened in Lexington,
January 1, 1832. In these gatherings the spirit of
the Master was supreme.</p>
<p>At the Lexington meeting, at an early hour the house
was crowded. Stone, John T. Johnson, Samuel Rogers, G.
W. Elley, Jacob Creath, &ldquo;Raccoon&rdquo; John Smith, and many
other worthy men were there, all guarded in thought and purpose
against any compromise of truth, but all filled with the
spirit of the Master: &ldquo;That they may all be one; even as
thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be
in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.&rdquo;
It was decided that one man from each party should speak,
setting forth clearly the grounds of union, and Smith and
Stone were selected as the speakers. After this had been
announced, the two brethren went aside, and conferred in
private. Neither knew what the other would say in the
critical hour which had now come upon the churches; nor
did either, in the moment of solemn conference, ask the
other to disclose his mind, touching their differences, more
fully than he had already done. It was decided between
them that Smith should speak first.</p>
<p>The occasion was to Smith the most important and
solemn that had occurred in the history of the reformation.
&ldquo;It was now to be seen whether all that had been written and
said and done in behalf of the simple gospel of Christ and
the union of Christians was really the work of the Lord, or
whether the prayers of Stone and Johnson were but the idle
longings of pious, yet deluded hearts; whether the toils and
sacrifices of Smith were but the schismatic efforts of a bold
enthusiast, and whether the teachings of Campbell were only
the speculations of a graceless and sensuous philosophy. The
denominations around mocked, and declared that a church
without a constitution could not stand, and that a union without
a creed was but the chimera of a dreamy and infatuated
heresy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, Smith, realizing the tremendous
importance of the occasion, arose with simple dignity, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
stood before the mingling brotherhoods. He felt the weight
that rested upon him. Every eye turned upon him, and every
ear leaned to catch the slightest tones of his voice. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God has but one people on the earth. He has given to
them but one Book, and therein exhorts and commands them
to be one family. A union such as we plead for&mdash;a union of
God&rsquo;s people on that one Book&mdash;must then be practicable.
Every Christian desires to stand complete in the whole will of
God. The prayer of the Savior, and the whole tenor of his
teaching, clearly show that it is God&rsquo;s will that his children
should be united. To the Christian, then, such a union must be
desirable. But an amalgamation of sects is not such a union
as Christ prayed for and God enjoins. To agree to be one
upon any system of human invention would be contrary to his
will, and could never be a blessing to the church or the world:
therefore the only union practicable or desirable must be based
on the Word of God as the only rule of faith and practice.
There are certain abstruse and speculative matters&mdash;such as
the mode of the divine existence and the ground and nature of
the atonement&mdash;that have for centuries, been themes of discussion
among Christians. These questions are as far from
being settled now as they were in the beginning of the controversy.
By a needless and intemperate discussion of them much
feeling has been provoked, and divisions have been produced.
For several years past I have tried to speak on such subjects
only in the language of inspiration, for it can offend no one
to say about those things just what the Lord himself has said.
In this scriptural style of speech all Christians should be
agreed. It can not be wrong; it can not do harm. If I come to
the passage, &ldquo;My Father is greater than I,&rdquo; I will quote it, but
will not stop to speculate upon the consubstantial nature of the
Father and the Son. &ldquo;Have this mind in you, which was also
in Christ Jesus: who existing in the form of God, counted not
the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,&rdquo; I will
not stop to speculate upon the consubstantial nature of the
Father and the Son. I will not linger to build a theory on such
texts, and thus encourage a speculative and wrangling spirit
among my brethren. I will present these subjects only in the
words which the Lord has given me. I know he will not be displeased
if we say just what he has said. Whatever opinions
about these and similar subjects I may have reached in the
course of my investigation, if I never distract the church of
God with them or seek to impose them on my brethren, they
will never do the world any harm.</p>
<p>I have the more cheerfully resolved on this course, because
the gospel is a system of facts, commands, and promises; and
no deductions or inferences from them, however logical or
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
true, forms any part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. No heaven
is promised to those who hold them, and no hell is threatened
to those who deny them. They do not constitute, singly or
together, any items of the ancient and apostolic gospel. While
there is but one faith, there may be ten thousand opinions;
and hence if Christians are ever to be one, they must be
one in faith, and not in opinion. When certain subjects arise,
and even in conversation or social discussion, about which
there is a contrariety of opinion and sensitiveness of feeling,
speak of them in the words of the Scriptures, and no offense
will be given, and no pride of doctrine will be encouraged. We
may even come, in the end, by thus speaking the same things,
to think the same things.</p>
<p>For several years past I have stood pledged to meet the
religious world, or any part of it, on the ancient gospel and
order of things as presented in the words of the Book. This
is the foundation on which Christians once stood, and on it
they can, and ought to, stand again. From this I can not
depart to meet any man, or set of men, in the world. While,
for the sake of peace and Christian union, I have long since
waived the public maintenance of any speculation I may hold,
yet not one gospel fact, commandment, or promise will I surrender
for the world. Let us, then, my brethren, be no longer
Campbellites or Stoneites, New Lights or Old Lights, or any
other kind of lights; but let us all come to the Bible, and to
the Bible alone, as the only book in the world that can give
us all the light we need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Smith had concluded, Stone arose, with his heart
filled with love and hope, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not attempt to introduce any new topic, but say a
few things on the subject presented by my beloved brother.
Controversies in the church sufficiently prove that Christians
can never be one in their speculations upon these mysterious
and sublime subjects, which, while they interest the Christian
philosopher, can not edify the church. After we have given up
all creeds and taken the Bible, and the Bible alone, as our rule
of faith and practice, we met with so much opposition that I
was led to deliver some speculative discourses upon these subjects.
But I never preached a sermon of that kind that really
feasted my heart; I always felt a barrenness of soul afterwards.
I perfectly accord with Bro. Smith that these speculations
should never be taken into the pulpit; and when compelled to
speak of them at all, we should do so in the words of inspiration.</p>
<p>I have not one objection to the ground laid down by him
as the true Scriptural basis of union among the people of God,
and I am willing to give him, now and here, my hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>And as he spoke these words, he extended his hand to
Smith, and it was grasped by a hand full of the honest pledges
of love and fellowship, and the union of these two bodies was
virtually accomplished. It was then proposed that all who
felt willing to unite on the principles enunciated should signify
it by giving to each other the hand of fellowship, and
at once the audience joyfully joined hands in joyful accord.
A song was sung, and, amid tears of inexpressible happiness,
the union was confirmed.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, some further friendly conferences
were held by means of committees, and by arrangement
the members of both churches communed together on
February 19, agreeing to consummate the formal and public
union of the two churches on the following Lord&rsquo;s day. During
the week, however, some began to fear a difficulty in relation
to the choice of elders and the practical adoption of
weekly communion, which they thought would require the
constant presence of an ordained administrator. The person
who generally ministered to the Christian Church at Lexington
at this time was Thomas Smith, a man of more than
ordinary abilities and attainments, and long associated with
the movement of Barton W. Stone. He was at first, apprehensive
that the proposed union was premature, and that
disagreements might arise in regard to questions of church
order. The union was therefore postponed, and matters remained
for a short time stationary, but it soon became apparent
to the Christians that there were no exclusive privileges
belonging to the preacher as it concerned the administration
of the ordinances, and Thomas M. Allen, who enjoyed the
esteem and confidence of the entire brotherhood, induced
them to complete the union and to transfer to the new congregation,
thus formed under the title of the &ldquo;Church of
Christ;&rdquo; the comfortable church house which they had previously
held under the designation of &ldquo;the Christian Church.&rdquo;
This wise measure secured entire unanimity, and the formal
and public union was consummated on February 26, as
had been previously arranged, when they again broke bread
together, and in that sweet and solemn communion again
pledged to each other their brotherly love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>At Paris, Mr. Allen also effected a union of the two
churches and the union at Georgetown, Lexington, and Paris
soon led to union throughout the state. This desire for unity
was greatly furthered by the efforts of John Smith and John
Rogers, who had been appointed at the Lexington meeting
to visit all the churches and hold meetings in conjunction with
each other. Their work was wonderfully successful throughout
Kentucky in uniting the two bodies. The effect of this
union was very great on those who had never made any profession
of religion. Multitudes became obedient to the faith
throughout Kentucky, and an impetus was given to the cause
by the union of the two peoples, which served to illustrate the
overwhelming power which the gospel would exert upon the
world if all the sad divisions among those who claim to follow
Christ were healed. The sectarians of Kentucky, who
had foretold a speedy disruption of the union, were surprised
to find their prophecies unfulfilled, and not less grieved
at the inroads continually made upon their own power, which,
from this period steadily and rapidly declined. It is
worthy of mention that at the time these events were happening
in Kentucky, the spirit of union was prevailing over
sectarianism in a number of other states also. Every preacher
among them was a missionary and traveling evangelist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This union of the Christians and Reformers was not
a surrender of one party to the other; it was an agreement
of such as already recognized and loved each other as brethren
to work and worship together. It was the union of those
who held alike the necessity of implicit faith and of unreserved
obedience; who accepted the facts, commands, and
promises as set forth in the Bible; who conceded the right
of private judgment to all; who taught that opinions were
no part of the faith delivered to the saints; and who were now
pledged that no speculative matters should ever be debated to
the disturbance of the peace and harmony of the church, but
when compelled to speak on controverted subjects, they
would adopt the style and language of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; It
was an equal and mutual resolution to meet on the Bible as
on common ground and to preach the gospel rather than to
propagate opinions.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
